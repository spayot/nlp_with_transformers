But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic!  Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot.  The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it's feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn't some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life as described in the Gospels and that's pretty much what he does.  There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment.  In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!).  The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch.  I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ's hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier's smirking face.  That's a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic.  Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial.  To read some press reviews I'd assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition.  If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism's staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ.  But hey, it's all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty \"Catholic\" film.  Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly.  They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death.  Speaking from the Protestant tradition I'd prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I'm not sure that this movie will make many converts - it's a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (\"This is my Body, broken for you...\" etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (\"Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise.\").  I'm not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it's already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it's a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can't wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended.

The movie focuses on the last 12 hours of Jesus' (Jim Caviezel) life leading up to his death and resurrection. This movie has some very graphic scenes, but don't let the violence concern you. It is a powerful depiction of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, thanks in part to its director, the brilliant Mel Gibson, who directed and starred as Justin Mcleod in \"The Man Without A Face\" and William Wallace in \"Braveheart\", the latter, which won him the Best Director Oscar. He also well known as Dr. Gibbon in \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), Graham Hess in \"Signs\" (2002), Lt. Col. Hal Moore in \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), Nick Marshall in \"What Women Want\" (2000), Benjamin Martin in \"The Patriot\" (2000), Porter in \"Payback\" (1999), Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon movies (1987, 1989, 1992, 1998), Jerry Fletcher in \"Conspiracy Theory\" (1997), Tom Mullen in \"Ransom\" (1996), the voices of Rocky and John Smith in \"Chicken Run\" (2000) and \"Pocahontas\" (1995), Bret Maverick in \"Maverick\" (1994), Capt.

His directing in this movie is brilliant without compromise. Everything he did to make this movie has paid off brilliantly. The cast including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother, are brilliant as well. Caviezel's performance as Jesus, is emotionally powerful and brilliant and as the co-anchor of the movie, besides, Gibson, does a brilliant job as much as Gibson did. Gibson's production company, Icon Productions, has produced movies of his such as, \"The Singing Detective\" (2003), \"Payback\" (1999), \"What Women Want\" (2000), \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"We Were Soldiers\" (2002), \"Fairy Tale: A True Story\" (1997), \"Forever Young\" (1992), \"Hamlet\" (1990), \"The Man Without A Face\" (1993), and \"Maverick\" (1994). The screenplay by Benedict Fitzgerald and Gibson is brilliant. The music by John Debney is brilliant. The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is brilliant. The film editing by John Wright is brilliant. The production design by Francesco Frigeri and the costume design by Maurizio Millenotti is brilliant. The casting by Shaila Rubin is brilliant. The set direction by Carlo Gervasi is brilliant. The visual and make-up effects by Greg Cannom and Keith Vanderlaan is brilliant. This movie make a powerful point about how Jesus died and the point is brilliant and succeeds on every level. The language, which is in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, which is shown in English subtitles, proves that you don't need to speak English to have a brilliant film with heart and soul. Go see this movie now or if you can see it. This is an achievement on every level. It is a movie to remember forever.", "qas": [{"question": "How is film?", "id": "6c49eb603f8d295bf919e7a13d4540e7", "answers": [{"text": "The film editing by John Wright is brilliant", "answer_start": 2189}, {"text": "The Passion Of The Christ", "answer_start": 1}]}]}, {"context": "I just had a few miscellaneous comments on a film that has already sparked a good deal of controversy.This was destined to be a controversial film right from the start, with the concerns ranging from whether it was too violent to whether it was anti-Semitic. Well, to address the first concern, you can't have a successful movie these days without a lot of gratuitous sex, drugs, and violence, and since this is 2000 years ago and there weren't that many recreational drugs back then, they probably had to step up the violence quotient a bit to compensate, although I suspect people had sex back then, too. It just wasn't the object of as much existential angst, and AIDS was 2000 years in the future, so there were certain advantages to living in ancient times, even if you couldn't run down to the corner store and get a cold sixpack at 2 am in the morning.But getting back to the movie, this is certainly a powerful and evocative depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and the entire cast really is superb. Although I usually don't like going to movies with subtitles, I didn't mind it in this case since Aramaic was the language of Jesus and it was interesting to hear it spoken, as I've only seen it written up to this point and had never heard it. A little piece of trivia here--classical Aramaic was thought by linguists to be another dead Semitic language (like Akkadian, Assyrian, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Punic, Coptic, Ammonite, Moabite, and the classical Arabic of the Koran, and Hebrew was dead until they brought it back), until an obscure congregation in Egypt and several other communities were found to be using it some years ago, although it was a more modern dialect. So I liked that aspect of the movie although I doubt I'll be trying to learn any dead Semitic languages anytime soon.The movie was indeed pretty violent, but ancient times certainly have no monopoly on violence compared to modern times, and more people died during the massive world wars and many smaller wars, genocides, purges, revolutions, and various other social conflagrations of the 20th century (which was at least 100 million people) than were probably even alive 2000 years ago. I also didn't find the movie anti-Semitic, and if the Jews hadn't killed Jesus some other group probably would have.So despite the controversial elements, overall, I think this was a well-done movie whose good points outweigh its bad points, and whatever the final critical judgment on it is, I'm sure the movie will be hotly debated and discussed for many years to come.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the thing?", "id": "53f9e8bee97df42b8e18988c9adc9918", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but when he is making a serious movie, he knows what he's doing.I thought \"Apocalypto\" was not very good, mainly because of its ridiculous violence and its quite one-dimensional portrayal of an entire culture. What was the point? Mel Gibson seemed to be saying \"boy, these people were violent and wrong.\"But this sort of unipolar viewpoint, which did not serve \"Apocalypto\" at all, fits this film to a tee. Gibson is clearly a committed Christian of the Catholic stripe, and he has created pretty much the ultimate cinematic portrayal of the story of Christ's crucifixion. I can't imagine a film which would better indicate the depth of the physical suffering that Jesus of Nazareth must have endured, and the emotional pain this would inflict upon his relatives and best friends.The sets are all very detailed and ring quite true to the period. The actors in lead \"good guy\" roles are perhaps a bit too European looking, but given the film's production in Italy, some of this is forgivable. Either way, people have cast these characters with their own ethnicity for eons, so I'm willing to give that a pass.I kind of wish some of the more mystical elements had been left out. Jesus heals a roman soldier during his capture. Judas is attacked (in his mind at least) by little hobgoblin demon children. Christ is also tempted by Satan - who is played and visualized quite well by a spooky-looking actress, but nonetheless this feels like a bit of a tacked on element, despite mentions in the Gospels at various points. These elements are at worst a minor annoyance, but they strain credulity, which probably runs counter to Gibson's purposes.I guess I would have preferred that the human elements of the story stand on their own, because, frankly, that's all we have access to at this late date. We simply can't trust miracle stories and talk of mystical happenings. We don't have access to them. But by meditating on the human aspects of the story, we have something we can relate to and which may inspire faith in the other, less tangible things. To display them openly is to assume their existence before we are faithful.But this is just my opinion, I suppose, based on my reading, studies in philosophy, and my general skeptical bent. I've never seen a miracle, and no one I've trusted has ever reported one to me. Things handed down from 2000 years ago, re-translated dozens of times, do not strike me as reliable sources for amazing stories, none of which seem to happen in modern history and with the benefit of all the technology we have available to us to record such events. I mean, given all the cell phone cameras out there, where are all the indubitable miracles?Anyhow, I digress (my apologies to David Hume...). Even with its mystical trappings, this film in its immediacy and its viscerality certainly succeeds in forcing the viewer to ponder the human aspects. The mystical stuff is a sideshow, so to speak.For those with faith, this film should offer a potent meditation on a story which has been ingrained into the psyche, practically since birth. For a non-believer, this film offers a valuable insight into the passion that believers have for this story and for the man himself. Like a Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth seems to have been a singular man, the like of which is rarely seen. Contemplating this can deepen a non-believer's appreciation, if not deliver them into a completely faithful orientation to the material.To put it briefly, it's a brilliant film. Each shot is lovingly composed, and the visual impact and beauty of the images can't be faulted. The performances all feel very real and there is no actor who takes the viewer away from the time period. Gibson, similar to some of the other great directors such as Kubrick, Scorsese, Stone and he like, excels at  creating \"scene.\" You really feel like 'you are there.'*******The Blu-Ray:The picture is quite beautiful. Black levels are solid, detail is quite good (though perhaps not the absolute best, I would say \"Dark Knight\" and \"Alexander\" top it), and color is very naturalistic. There is a bit of \"posterization\" in some shots of the sky (i.e. a sort of digital distortion or dot-crawl), but it only intrudes on 10 or 20 seconds of the film, and is probably in the source material. The DTS audio mix offers some nice directional effects, with crowd taunts and bird chirps in the rear sound field.Technically, it's about as good as I can imagine it looking. I did not see the film in the theater, so I cannot compare the level of fidelity.Extras include commentaries, and a \"recut\" version, which apparently is actually a bit shorter than the theatrical release. This version also cuts a bit of violence. A word to parents - cutting five minutes of gruesome violence leaves about, oh, 120 minutes of gruesome violence remaining in the movie. So plan accordingly insofar as your children can tolerate these kinds of things. Other extras: There are several commentaries on the main disc. The extra disc has many short documentaries on both production issues and historical context, though none are in HD, unfortunately.*********So should you buy it? Well, that's a tough question. If you're a devoted Christian who enjoys pondering these mysteries, and you also have a good HD setup, then sure, I can't see any reason not to. If you are not a Christian but are curious about what the hub-bub is about, then this is definitely worth at least a rental. Fans of historical fiction/docudrama will certainly find much to appreciate.Whether or not you buy it, this is definitely a film everyone should see at least once. It is a great film, like it or lump it. It is a vivid and very impactful telling of one of the very few central stories of our global culture. Keep in mind I do not want to put a Christian gloss on humanity here - if there were comparable films on Mohammad (a bit of an issue given the icon prohibition), Buddha, etc., I would recommend seeing those as well.On the whole, by any standards, this is a five-star release. It may not be for everyone's permanent collection. But those who add this Blu-Ray title to their shelf will not be disappointed.", "qas": [{"question": "How did you like  the reviewer?", "id": "79b2c4aa8c64e898ad28ca95dc4829d6", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "On February 25, 2004 at 5:30 PM, I wasn't exactly sure how to feel because I was sitting in front of a screen that was ready to project what's been called one of the most controversial and brutal films ever made. I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn't sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, \"The Passion of the Christ\" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.\"The Passion,\" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson's finest work (he had previously directed \"Bravehart\" and \"The Man Without a Face,\" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that's how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson's work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as \"The Natural\" and \"The Patriot.\" To further Mel's perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney's score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it's not my job to do what I really don't want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn't, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that's all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let's think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that's anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there's enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that's all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it's not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn't a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and \"the passion\" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs. You will be moved by this great motion picture epic, I guarantee it.Grade: A++ (first ever)-Rock Hogan", "qas": [{"question": "How was the movie?", "id": "7914ffb7c941bb7ea45ec85a6363b87c", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The Passion of the Christ, the very controversial Mel Gibson religious epic has been highly anticipated and now released.  I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can't \"like\" or \"dislike.\"  The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it's based upon.  The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ's life.  The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children.  Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney's engrossing music score.  James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others.  Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart.  I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel.  Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life, he's not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend.  It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film's budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film.  This is the second-highest grossing \"R\" rated film after The Matrix Reloaded.  Of course you shouldn't see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you're very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence.  The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal.  During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus's hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus's body is drenched with blood.  There's also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.

It has a beauty all its own as well.Now let me use another g word. Gory. Be warned: This film is NOT meant as entertainment.

Be sure you know what a child can and cannot handle.Let me cut to the chase here. This film to me is NOT anti-Semitic. It did make me think though. It made me think how lucky I am that Jesus Christ really loves me and loves me enough that He would and has died for my sins and the sins of the world AND risen from the dead so that all who call on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord can be with Him in Heaven forever. As a Christian, this film was a graphic reminder to me of the incredible price that my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ paid to redeem me from sin and death, and when I thought of that, I felt extremely blessed, lucky, and LOVED. I lnow the Bible speaks of this, and I am not saying this film should replace the Living Word of God, but it was for me a reminder of all that I just mentioned here.In short, go and see this if you can. It is a film that will make you cringe, and likely weep with the brutality it depicts, but it will also likely touch your heart and move you in a way that few movies ever can.

This film is the best film I have ever seen on Earth! It was [way] better than Titanic (no offense Titanic fans)! Finally, I get to see what this film... or this true story looks like. First of all, this isn't a film. It was REAL!!! Big time! Now for my review. This movie opens up with Jesus (my favorite character... or person...) who is upset that he has twelve hours to live, because he is about to be crucified. Hours have passed and he was taken to the Romans. After they sentence to punish him, they start beating him up with chains, whips, and other dangerous weapons. I covered my eyes, because it was too painful. After they beat him up, they want to sentence him to death. So they have him carry a cross, while he is severely injured, but Mary thinks about the good times Jesus and her spend, including the close encounter part which really brought a tear in my eye. When we get there, they nailed Jesus on the cross and raise him up, but not before we see a flashback about his bread as his body and the drink as his blood. After he and his cross rose vertically, they knew the job was done, and everyone laughed at him. However, they clouds rolled in, and everyone knew what will happen: After Jesus prays to his father for the last time, he dies and he will be in heaven for sure. Rain starts to fall, causing a huge earthquake. Now, I think this is a little... flat, but the people who crucified Jesus NOW finally realized they did something wrong. They knew they did something bad to him, but it was too late for that. After they release Jesus from the cross, he is held by his mother, Mary. However, in April 3, the first Easter ever to be created, the covers he lied in when he died was empty, because Jesus is living with his father, but, before the credits roll, we see Jesus resurrected, proving that even though he died, he was still alive. I think the ending was so powerful, and, in my opinion, I think it was the best ending ever. It left my heart thumping for good. The only complaint was that there was no English dialouge, but there's not suppose to be an English dialouge, because it wasn't held in our region. I still think it makes sense to me. This movie is the best movie I've seen in Earth, and it should not be missed. GO SEE IT NOW!!! Well done Mel Gibson for giving us the gift of a powerful movie!!!

The filming is graphic and detailed and the decision to have people speak in their original languages was very intelligent.  The film has been accused of being antisemitic--partly because of Gibson's escapades-but I don't see it.  It is no more antisemitic than the Gospels, themselves.  Yes, I think it can be argued that the Gospels show an anti-Pharasee bias--make that an anti-establishment bias--but they can't be antisemitic.  The early Christians, precisely the ones who wrote the New Testament, were all Jews.  It is hardly credible that they were antisemites.  They were, however, members of a new wave of Judaism, a wave that witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the razing of Herod's Temple.  They didn't like the Temple Establishment and their writings show it, sometimes even glossing over the Roman responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.The film is both detailed and excruciating.  It emphasizes Jesus' suffering for mankind.  It's difficult to 'overdo' something as hideous as death by crucifixion but I think the directors come close.  The scourging is overdone to the point of unbelievability.  It goes on far too long and is laid on with too much force.  The scourging of the type depicted may have killed a man without the necessity of a cross.  Of a near absolute certainty, a man so scourged would never be able to pull--even with help--the cross up to the hill of Golgotha.Other than that I have only one other technical comment and that involves the cross, itself.  The cross has become the living symbol of many Christian faiths but many people believe that there was never a cross.  There is evidence that, in some places, the uprights were always kept in place on the execution ground.  The condemned man carried the crosspiece on his shoulder to the place of execution.In A.D. 70, Jerusalem fell to a Roman army and thousands were crucified around its walls.  It seems highly unlikely that full crosses were used in the executions.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\"Skull Rack\" and \"Hummingbird God\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico", "qas": [{"question": "What is the best scene in the movie?", "id": "f5f79ec5df2f0b246740c9e74a787cb7", "answers": [{"text": "good", "answer_start": 10}]}]}, {"context": "I never was a religious person. But nevertheless I have to say that \"The Passion of the Christ\" is something. I can't recall when a movie had such an impact on me. It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.\"The Passion of the Christ\" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I'm utterly impressed and dazed.If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any.

One year, on the brink of starvation, the villagers decide to hire ronin (masterless samurai) to protect them. With only meagre payment of 3 meals a day, their quest seems an impossible one.I`d heard so much from many friends about this being one of the greatest movies ever made - and in my opinion thats` not far wrong. Initially I was apprehensive, not because of the subtitles (I`m not a stranger to them, being a fan of foreign cinema) but because it was such a long film (over 3 hours), and I wasn`t sure about its` pacing for example since the basic plot of the film is a very simple one. Though I had seen a Kurosawa film before (Rashomon - 1950) many consider Seven Samurai to be his masterpiece, which I was a newcomer to.I needn`t have worried about anything. Its` a very important film in World cinema - and its` got everything in it - drama, memorable characters, comedy, pathos, action and raw emotion. You really care about the characters in this film and what happens to them.The climactic battle with the bandits and samurai, fought in splattering mud and pouring rain for example, is brilliantly done, and Kurosawa doesn`t flinch at showing us the violence and horror that occurs. The impact he had on cinema cannot be underestimated - many techniques, such as the use of slow motion to increase the impact of an action scene (which would later be implemented by HK maestros Chang Cheh and John Woo) were being seen on screen here for the very first time. It may be difficult to imagine how revolutionary that was for the audience.The plot may be simplistic, but in the hands of a master film-maker, this really isn`t a problem as you`re always absorbed in these character`s lives.Toshiro Mifune (who would appear in a lot of Kurosawa`s features) is excellent as Kikuchiyo, the farmers` son is also an aspiring samurai. He is a crazy and wild character.The great scene in which he makes a blistering speech berating both the samurai for being evil and the farmers for being greedy is not without irony, first since he is clad in full samurai garb and second because the things he hits out at when accusing the samurai (killing people, raping women, stealing crops, burning houses) were being carried out a mere ten years before by the Japanese military in the Second World War. Also, up until that point in the film he had been nothing but a clown, which makes the turn all the more powerful.Kurosawa also debunks the myth of the classic samurai hero, usually painted as fearless and invincible. In a scene where two samurai are talking one asks the other what he does in the face of danger. `I lie low in a ditch` he replies. `Then I run away`Its` a mark of how good this film is that even today things are being drawn from it - most famously of course remade as the Western The Magnificent Seven (1960) by John Sturges, but even Disney have to thank him, as their 1998 computer animated comedy A Bug`s Life is based on Kurosawa`s film.I`m ever so pleased I saw this - if you`re a fan of World cinema (heck, just cinema in general) you really must see it. Don`t be hesitant by its` long runtime, subtitles or its full frame ratio. Its` a marvellous film.Trust me on this.This DVD from the Criterion Collection features the rarely seen original US Theatrical Trailer for Seven Samurai, plus a full length commentary (something lacking in the BFI Region 2 release) by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck. I`ll admit I haven`t heard all of that yet, though what I`ve heard so far is very interesting!This version is the fully restored cut of the film (206 minutes) which includes a short intermission and has been transferred from a new 35mm composite low contrast print. Considering the age of the film, I was impressed with how it looked, though certain shots looked really fuzzy and were like watching through mist (probably due to the age/condition of the materials though).", "qas": [{"question": "How is the quality of the film?", "id": "16f1b825ebd92a5a3bd4264ce41eb12b", "answers": [{"text": "but because it was such a long film", "answer_start": 521}]}]}]}, {"title": "0780621964", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I liked the first movie a lot so when the second one came out I went to see it,I jus have to say one word about it: CRAP.I have to admit the effects and the fighting scenes were not bad, but I think there was too  much characters (many of them appeared for seconds) and the story went too  fast, it seems like the producers saw that MK was going down in popularity  so they decided to put three movies in one.", "qas": [{"question": "Does this movie have good or rubbish effects?", "id": "e9ee89b1170b3a6f4bbb39a736871ca8", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0780623134", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In just about every department - plot, dialogue, and acting, you simply cannot go wrong with Shawshank Redemption!This remains one of my all-time favorite films even having seen it several times already.

The parts dealing with Derek's past are shot in black and white to give them more of an ominous appeal. The present is shot in color to give the appearance of hope. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard. He plays both sides of the character great. He is very convincing as a skinhead, and after prison shows that redemption is possible. Edward Furlong in my opinion did the best job in the movie. Furlong supplies extremely realistic emotion to let the audience know the inner conflict that his character is dealing with.

After that, six sequels were made.  Now, they are all in one box set that is a must own.  I totally love it!  There are so many great things about these movies.  The dream sequences, the characters, and especially Freddy Krueger make them all enjoyable in their own way.  These movies are especially interesting because they don't consist of the same kind of usual killer.  Sure, there is Michael, Leatherface, and Jason, but who cares?  There are all the same.  Freddy is totally different.  He instead kills people in their dreams, which make for an intriguing storyline.  I never exactly admired Freddy Krueger.  I'll admit I was into Michael and Jason, but Freddy has more style.The first one comes off just right.  The whole plot made sense and made it scary to know that are dreams could be reality.  The later installments do not live up to the first, but some are very good and are directed by Renny Harlin (one of my favorite directors!), Rachel Talalay, and, of course, Wes Craven.  Everyone of these deserves a watch.A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) - The best one out of them all.  This one is where it all began and so did Johnny Depp's career.  Heather Langenkamp is great as Nancy.  Robert Englund was outstanding (and would be for the next 6 installments) as Fred Krueger, the dream stalker.  This has a good, creepy mood to it.  (10/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, language, and partial nudity.  \"I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy!\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 (1985) - This one was a bit weird.  First off, it forgot the idea of Freddy (Englund) being in your dreams and made him become a real person in life.  He begins to take over Jessie's (Mark Patton) body and starts killing people again.  Second, it didn't explain its characters that well.  It wasn't that scary, but it was entertaining.  Mark Patton wasn't that great.  He mostly just screamed like a girl the whole movie and wore dorky clothing.  (6/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, brief nudity, and some language.  \"You've got the body, I've got the brain!\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 (1987) - Forgot about the last movie and went on to a different plot.  There are teens at a psychiatric ward that are suffering from bad dreams about Fred Krueger (Englund, who is very creepy in this one).  Anyway, the kids start to die one by one.  They find out that they have special powers in their dreams and that they can maybe defeat Freddy for good.  The movie was good, but I didn't need to see that one kid turn into a wizard (a bit corny!).  There are some really cool scenes in this one.  (7/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, nudity, sexual situations, and language.  \"Your big break in T.V.!\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 (1988) - This is one of my personal favorites.  This one had everything from cool dream sequences to great characters, to vivid colors, and many more.  Too bad that they killed off the remaining Dream Warriors.  I felt really bad when Joey Crusel died off.  Anyway, the new characters are just as great, especially Lisa Wilcox as Alice.  Danny Hassel is also great as Dan.  This is one that you need to see.  (8/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, nudity, and language.  \"How's this for a wet dream?!\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 (1989) - My least favorite one.  It turned away from the colorful Part 4 and turned into a gothic and disgusting movie.  Lisa Wilcox returns and so does Danny Hassel.  He dies into the movie fairly quickly though.  Then were left with one-dimensional characters.  It was a pretty stupid plot and movie.  Alice (Wilcox) has an unborn child and it is killing her friends by letting Freddy get into its mind.  Don't bother!  (4/10)  Rated R for graphic sequences of violence, gore, and some language.  \"Put the pedal to the medal, Dan!\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) - This also one of my favorites.  It is not a great movie, but it is very entertaining.  There is a great soundtrack also.  Freddy (Englund) is more goofy in this one.  It's pretty funny though.  The dream sequences are pretty nifty and there isn't a lot of gore (which is good).  A young Breckin Meyer plays a stoner, Spencer, and he's pretty funny.  The plot is about 4 teenagers and their psychiatric helper that go to Springwood, where all the children have died from Freddy.  Freddy begins to kill them off, but there is a link between Freddy and one of the 5 people.  This also sets up some back round on who Freddy is.  This movie is just for a good time.  You can also watch the ending in 3-D if you have the box set.  This is a movie you have to see.  (7/10)  Rated R for violence/light gore, language, drug use, and human abuse.  \"Hey Spence, let's trip out!\"Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) - Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Nick Corri, Wes Craven, and others play themselves in this movie.  There is another \"Nightmare\" sequel coming into production.  Heather (herself) is going to play Nancy.  Yet, as the movie we are watching progresses, the script is being made the way we watch it.  So, in the end, everything in the movie was made into the script.  Soon, people start dying on the set and Heather's son (Miko Hughes) begins to act like Freddy.  Heather decides to take on the role of Nancy once more and take Freddy down for good.  Okay, this movie is really confusing.  I never knew if I was watching a movie, a dream, or a movie inside a movie.  Freddy is rarely seen, which is a good thing.  His make-up isn't that good in this one.  It looks like melted rubber and it doesn't go well.  I also thought this was the one where Freddy became scary again.  I really didn't think so.  It came off as a bit of a disappointment in the end.  (6/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, and language.  \"Come here, my piggy.  I got some gingerbread for you!\"The Nightmare Encyclopedia - This is a great disc for all the information about the Nightmare On Elm Street series.  There are three things to choose from on the menu: PRIMETIME, INDEX, and LABYRINTH.  \"Primetime\" is an introduction to the disc and Wes Craven talks about how the first \"Nightmare\" was made by using his own childhood memories.  The \"Index\" contains all seven movies and you can go into the making of the movies and how things were done.  \"Labyrinth\" is a tricky little thing, but fun.  You go through maze-like hallways, going into rooms, searching through cabinets for deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, alternate endings, documentaries, and much more.  This eighth disc is really helpful and a lot of fun.  It is a nice addition to the collection.  (10/10)All together, this makes a great set that is definitely worth owning.

Since the review has already been published I can't change the star rating.As I've said before, Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the most overrated fillmmakers. The only movie of his I liked was Boogie Nights (although I have not yet seen Hard Eight but have heard good things). He seems to get high praise because his films are bizarre and hard to follow. It seems that if a person doesn't understands a film thery think it must be over their heads. I gave this 2 stars because of what it could have been. This could have made 2 really good 90 min films, it could've even made 4 good 30 min short films; instead, it's a 3hr overdrawn depression filled movie. On the plus, it has a really great soundtrack. It seems PT Anderson can't make anything really happy or have any hope. The only really good performances were from John C. Reily, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Tom Cruise. The scene where the actors sing along was pretty cool and the direction was very energetic. But, most of these characters are just so self centered you can't feel sorry for them. And once again Anderson puts in a scene that makes no sense (a plague of frogs, and I'm not joking) and somehow people think it's prolific. Still, this isn't as gut-wrenchingly horrible as his next film Punch-Drunk Love, but it's not nearly as good as Boogie Nights.I will say that my favorite scene was the begining about coincedences.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the tolerance for violence?", "id": "c90ef69e141184cb14bade49d55dbe45", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0782002064", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This movie \"Ist das Leben nicht schoen\" (Its a wonderful life) is in the german speaking part unknow and only rare showed on TV.

I really find the man who directed this movie Steven Spielburg to be one of the best altime movie directors ever hands down He can do an incredible job Directing a horror movie, Scifi film like Star wars or a movie like American Graffiti.So what I like about this film is that the plot is acually quit simple a woman has been eaten alive bya shark which nobody knows what kind so the Sheriff  in charge makes everybody close down the beach for a while until the shark that killed this woman and other people is killed.It takes the sheriff a little while to shut down the beach for good until the shark is caught cause the owner of the beach only cares about money and not the sake of the people but he does change his mind after he sees the effect that this has on the people of the beach so the hunt is on for the shark that did this. You wont believe the ending to this incredible film. A must see for anybody that likes not just horror films but Steven Spielburg's films. I withoubt a doubt give this film 5 stars. Sharks are scary!!!!!!!", "qas": [{"question": "How is the direct?", "id": "61ba4bcf67749b563c999465426886ec", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0783221487", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Where to start with this review (Updated Review).I purchased this from Amazon because it had long been rumored that the original production of Dune filmed so much material that they could slice and rescast this movie into several adaptations.  Rumors of a 4+ hour adaptation abound and I have to admit, I saw a very long version of this movie on television but I think they just added commmercials to make it long.  Nonetheless, the promise of getting to see some of the previously unseen footage was enough to make me buy.  An interview on this extended DVD set clears up the mystery that there was never enough footage for 4+ hour version --- however this new release does include never before seen footage.I'll tell you what I like about the original:It made me think.  I was a teen when I saw the original movie and I hadn't read the book at that time.  I must say, this movie in its original form forced me to think and read into characters.When you see the original movie, the director did a phenomenal job of adapting the book to a movie and once you read the book you'll see the hard work that was put into this movie in its original form.  Lynch dropped subtle details into the movie that added to the mythology like small comments on thinking machines and how they were frowned upon etc that really made you wonder about this world.  The Orange Catholic bible etc.  Few movies out there and few directors were so careful to add so many small details to this work.  I don't know if Lynch was ever happy with the production but his efforts came through loud and clear to me.  However, due to the volume of work, the audience had to be an interested audience (this is not a hang your brain at door movie)....you have to watch everything and listen to everything because most things have a meaning.About the Flaws people see with this movie:Many people think its incomprehensible....You have to understand that the book Frank Herbert wrote is genius..  It bespeaks of the second coming of Christ only 10,000 years in the future.  The book is over 500 pages and then there are several additional books written by Herbert in the series that create a whole mythology around the world he created.  This is allot of ground for an audience to cover in a couple of hours.To add to this, you have to be versed in Science Fiction, Medieval Feudal Europe, The Catholic Church, Physics, Politics, Current Events (Intifada issues) & Middle Eastern Affairs, Mecantile Europe, Medieval life at court, and have an open mind & inventive mind and knowledge of several other areas.If you don't care for those topics or don't have time to know something about this, then this movie regardless of how they recast the movie, it will be incomprehensible and I recommend you steer well clear of the books as well.On the other hand, with a bit of reading and an open mind, this movie is reachable to most every 15 year old with a basic Western Education.About this Extended Edition ---The good:Getting the opportunity to see some previously unseen footage is worth the price of admission for this extended edition.  They did a good job in knitting the whole story by reslicing the material.  However, I would definitely call it somebody's else's Dune because the recutting definitely gives it a different feel and flavor.The case is slick and exactly what I would expect for a release to a global fanbase for what could be one of the greatest stories ever told.The extended edition is anamorphic widescreen which is a nice treat.  There are some cut scenes that are nice but no commentary or any nicer features that I could see.  They did have some nice interviews on how they did it, special effects, costumes etc that were a nice contextual extras.Now for the Bad:Some people did not like the original cut of movie and in response the studio, I think, tried to make this rendition more comprehensive by making extended edition in the hopes of engaging a wider audience....the original problem remains -- how to feed 6+ hours of details and content into 2 or so hours.In The old movie Urulan introduces the movie perfectly and then you cut to a simple communication between the \"guild\" which has them send a navigator to \"demand\" from the emperor details.  That original introduction was perfect....then you'd cut and see Urulan walk by as the Navigator arrived at the Emperor's palace.  An interraction between the Emperor and the Navigator shed so much light to the original movie and most of the context you need to get through it.In the new adaptation, you start off with an overly long cartoonish explanation that indeed doesn't shed enough light to really state what is at the heart of the problems the imperium faces (details that Lynch expertly peppered into the original with a casual comment here and there already).  Albeit this new intro has some very engaging cartoons, I think its still best to say less and force the audience to think...all the cartoon does is destroy mythology...but don't get me wrong, I appreciate the hard work they did in extending the movie and showing us more.Overall, I think the original movie where Urulan introduces the movie and then the cut to her at court in the original movie is perfect (not to mention that she's gorgeous....gorgeous princess introducing vs voice of some guy?) ---- even the sci fi channel adaptation ends with a beautiful fadeout where Urulan is left alone.  The original can't be beat.On packaging, I would've expected 2 or 3 CDs to go with the gorgesous case for the fans....but instead we get a single CD that you flip to get both versions of the movie.  This should've been 1 original, 1 extended, 1 extras CDs. It seems like they paid for the case and skimped on the CDs...I would've paid $29.99 for better packaging and extras.Overall:Not everyone likes all movies and this one is no different.  I am a believer as other reviewers have noted that Dune is a \"love it or hate it affair.\" Indeed I have found this to be the case.  First you have to get this movie and then you have to apprecite it.  Many people don't even get to the \"getting it part\" for whatever reason....because they're turned off by sci fi, the graphic gothic nature of some scenes, or don't know about the various topics you have to know about etc.Personally, I think this extended edition is worth buying just for the extra scenes and some of the special featurettes.  I am however, still a huge fan of the original rendition and prefer it to this extended edition, the extended tv edition, and the sci fi channel miniseries.  I'll visit Lynch's Dune over any other to date.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the visual effect?", "id": "67f84d22d927638a6014c9abb8eea17f", "answers": [{"text": "this movie into several adaptations", "answer_start": 206}]}]}, {"context": "Basically all the criticisms of this movie upon its release are on point. The story is choppy and confusing; the special effects are terrible, even for 1984; and the appearance of the film in general leaves you wondering if the intent was not to make a serious recreation of the novel but rather something campy, like \"Flash Gordon\" -- except that it is much darker, with occasional gory intrusions. What you're left with is basically all the novel's mumbo-jumbo (\"Bene Gesserit,\" \"Maud'Dib,\" \"Kwisatz Haderach\") but nothing of the sense you get from the best science fiction of a complete, alternate time and place. In addition, some of the acting is downright terrible, especially Brad Dourif's (Piter de Vries), whoever he is. Sting too, while bringing back memories of his hairstyles from that era, is pretty unconvincing. Poor Max von Sydow cannot but come across well, but he's killed after about 10 minutes on screen. There's really no saving this movie: fans who wanted it to work, and wanted David Lynch to do it well, can maintain that it was brutal editing that caused the problem, but it's just not the case. No amount of additional scenes would have made this a good movie. It is definitely a disappointment. On top of it all, this DVD release (I am reviewing the \"extended version,\" with the theatrical cut on side A and the \"Alan Smithee\" version on side B) looks very poor. It's been put into a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, which sounds fine, if uninspiring, but the picture quality looks rough and aged.

Now this film sits comfortably in my top 5 modern horror films of all time along with Tobe Hooper's `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974), John Carpenter's `Halloween' (1974), Ridley Scott's `Alien' (1979) and Lucio Fulci's `The Beyond' (1981).The Thing is loosely a remake of the Howard Hawks / Christian Nyby original 1951 sci-fi film `The Thing From Another World' although it tends to adhere more faithfully to the original John W Campbell Jr. short story `Who Goes There?' The short story had stronger elements of paranoia that was missing in the original film but is restored superbly here. Each character has a distinct and well-developed personality all of their own which is unique in sci-fi / horror films where each character is picked off one by one. The ending appears to be have been left open for a sequel which never appeared although I believe now in hindsight that adds to the strength of the film in that we're still don't know if the remaining characters are infected. Credit has to be given to Bill Lancaster who adapted the short story into the screenplay.Along with `Alien' this film led to the resurgent interest in Sci-Fi /Action films in the eighties most notably for the developments in special make-up effects that were delivered here by Rob Bottin (The Fog, The Howling, Robocop, Seven, Fight Club) with some help from animatronic expert Stan Winston (Terminator, Aliens, T2, Jurassic Park). They were allowed to go crazy with their ideas and in the end they produced some memorable gory scenes. Palmer's (a character) response at seeing the spider-head, sounds like it could have come directly from John Carpenter at seeing Bottin's ideas. Cinematography was by Dean Condey who shot Carpenter's `Halloween' (1974) and would later go on to shoot other popular Sci-Fi films of the period like Zemeckis' `Back To The Future' and Speilberg's `Jurassic Park'.The score was created by probably the most famous film scorer in history, Ennio Morricone, who has literally hundreds of film credits to his name. His most famous work has been for Sergio Leone (The Good, The Bad and the Ugly; Once Upon a Time in the West). The gentle thumping on the score kind of portrays the heartbeat of an unseen enemy reminiscent of some industrial ambient drone music of the period.`The Thing' was not a failure at the box office although it did struggle against Spielbergs child-friendly `E.T.' which was released two weeks earlier. It would go on to create a massive cult following upon it's release on video which was when I first saw it, although I never did see E.T. until many years later. In a period now when just about every film is remake of some past classic and particularly with the current interest in horror it's great to see just how well this holds up not only against the original but even now, 23 years later. Cinema hasn't really moved on since the 1970s and as a result this film still feels remarkably fresh. So buy this and if you haven't seen the original it's worth checking out also, it's an excellent example of a 1950s Sci-Fi B-film. It's definitely worth replacing that old video with the DVD.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the rest?", "id": "a7cd75de718284e5b2909b19595795d3", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0783232101", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Capital Punishment has always been a sensitive subject in the movie industry.

As boasted in the movie trailers, &quot;American Beauty&quot; proves that a comedy can be serious, and a drama can be humorous.The film contains a large cargo of controversial issues, from drug use and dysfunctional families to homosexuality and sexual relationships that span two different age groups. In a time period where so many people are too timid to discuss these issues it is refreshing to see that a movie which is widely available to the general public is carrying all of these issues among its lines of dialogue and sweeping camera shots. Director Sam Mendes keeps the movie going at its own unique pace, bringing the characters to life with a top-notch cast and a superb crew.Kevin Spacey is the ever-drab Lester Burnham, a typical suburban male who leads a monotonous, routine lifestyle with his domineering, real-estate wife Carolyn, and his emotionally-distanced daughter Jane. A typical day at work and a family dinner are among the many aspects of life shown through Lester's eyes. When Carolyn and Lester attend Jane's cheerleading performance at a school basketball game, Lester is suddenly thrown into a world of sexual fantasy when he lays eyes on his daughter's friend, Angela Hayes. This begins his descent/ascent, and is soon working out to build up his body for his new love and smoking joints he gets from his teenage next door neighbor. He quits his job, blackmails his old boss, and begins working as a short-order cook at a fast-food restaurant.This is perhaps one of the most controversial films ever. But, it is also one of the most hauntingly realistic and powerful movies that has ever moved audiences to feel such emotion for life and connection to the characters it portrays. Each scene has its own way of making us believe in the emotions that Lester is experiencing, and very soon, we are in his world, going through the life that he is living, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and sometimes bewildered by his actions. To be able to feel that deep a connection is the mark of a truly great film.Kevin Spacey makes the most unbelievable character in history, bringing such hilarity and laughter to the screen, while at the same time making sure the audience knows that his character is being totally serious and sincere in his actions, and not doing it for mere attention. Annette Bening is wonderful in her role as Carolyn, who is the strong yet very fragile wife of Lester. She has a wonderful knack for showing her emotion, whether it be happy or sad, at all times of filming. The teenage actors, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley, are superbly rendered here, making the teenage aspect of the story realistic and memorable.The film has a great deal to offer for all age groups who watch it.

And even though these things she said would happen did not happen, she is still seen as a hero, and not a nutcase, and she runs around like a nutcase telling everyone that each day is a gift. A gift from whom? Since the future is not set, and assuming here that God has nothing to say about this, the gift must largely come from Sarah. Its just a moviem, and perhaps we don't really want to go in this direction. Maybe it was a good idea that this alternate ending was never used.This Ultimate Edition of the second Terminator movie is one of the three best movies I have for sound. I have a Pioneer Elite sound system with 5.1, B & W speakers, and a Panasonic HD TV. My system rocks. Therefore, when a new edition was offered with better sound and picture, I was interested. I can say that my setup can tell the difference between very good and very, very good. And as very good as the Ultimate Edition is, the Extreme Edition is even better. If someone wants to buy my Ultimate Edition dvd, I will be happy to sell it to them, and I will be more than happy to keep my Extreme edition.", "qas": [{"question": "Does it have a single feature?", "id": "40e871e9e65d8f7c92c6c7be0a5314dd", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This classic SF adventure has never looked better than it does on Blu-Ray.

It's what director James Cameron was said to have wanted with \"Titanic.\" Now, he gets his way. The disc contains two versions of the movie, the primary theatrical release and a special, extended version, plus over forty special features. I'm not entirely sure I agree with Ronald's assessment of the film's having an entertainment value of 10, but I'm willing to concede the point in its \"Ultimate Edition\" trappings. I certainly concur with everything else Ronald said, especially that \"Terminator 2\" belongs in any sci-fi collection. Now, before I comment on the special bonus items, here's more of what Ronald said about the movie itself...the first DVD to utilize the medium's full potential--over six hours of material on a single dual-layered, dual-sided disc.\"The first terminator failed to change history. It's up to a second terminator to terminate John Conner in his youth years after the attempt to kill his mother. Granted, just another cyborg won't do. The terminator sent back to change history has the ability to emulate any non-mechanical object it comes in contact with, but Arnold Schwarzenegger is up to the task of saving the world, even against an indestructible, morphing adversary in this terminator-on-terminator battle.Thanks to the marvels of time travel, John Conner was raised believing that the world would be devastated and he would lead the rebellion against the machines. His mother, however, was committed for being delusional. After all, how could machines take over the world? Now, two terminators show up, and he realizes that his mother was right.\"Video & Audio:The audio and video for the movie are fine. Definitely high quality. The sound and anamorphic picture are THX certified, but more important, the detail in sound staging is excellent. For instance, in one of the opening scenes, a motorcycle drives by on the road, and the audio definitely tracks with the location of the bike, even though it's a simple background noise. Amazing battles, fights, explosions, gun shots, and chase scenes leave the viewer enjoying the movie, not just admiring its technical perfection. The picture is slightly light, overall, and perhaps a tad soft. I would have liked a greater color depth.More from Thomson: \"'T2' is not perfect, the acting leaving much to be desired. But then, so is the acting in \"Star Wars\" imperfect. In both cases, however, the acting does not detract from the movies' overall effectiveness, presentation, or entertainment value.\"Extras:Thanks, Ronald, now let's hit those new bonus features, starting with side one, which is labeled \"Side A\" in print so small you have to hold it to the light and squint to read it. This is the main side, and the first thing you'll notice when it starts up is the snazzy new interface. The animated menu design looks like the inside of a robotics factory for terminator cyborgs. However, while it's beautiful to look at, it presents some problems getting around. A warning comes with the package (which is housed, by the way, in a handsome brushed-aluminum casing) stating that \"due to the advanced features utilized in the creation of this DVD, some players may experience minor navigational difficulties.\" My Sony 7700 player had no technical difficulty navigating the menus, but I had trouble finding everything I needed to. Some of the directional arrows are so dark and so tiny, they can be hard to spot, and they are often not located with the rest of the items on a screen. It also took me a moment to locate the THX tests advertised on the box. They're in the audio section and indicated by a little \"THX\" sign on the skeletal metal head to the left of the main audio choices. Once you find these tests, though, which are about the same as those found on the \"Fight Club\" DVD and basically duplicate the tests on most standard DVD setup discs like \"Video Essentials,\" you'll find them handy to use. They include checks for color calibration, brightness, convergence, channel balance, channel-phase polarity, subwoofer integration, and other such criteria for optimizing a home theater.Now, you're almost ready to choose which version of the movie you want to watch. The first is the regular theatrical release at 136 minutes; the other is the special edition with sixteen minutes of additional material. Some of this extra stuff is in bits and pieces scattered about; and some of it is contained in completely new scenes, raising the chapter index to an astounding eighty selections, maybe a record of its kind, an index point for about every two minutes of screen time! If you have already seen the film, and who hasn't, I advise watching the special edition; it's one of the few instances where the added material makes sense and isn't just included as a gimmick. But the chapter selections menu is no longer animated as it was in the previous disc. I suppose some things had to go, and it's a miracle the engineers were able to cram as much as they did on both sides of one disc. Anyway, the side also contains four different audio tracks: one in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX, another in DTS 5.1 ES, a third in Dolby Surround 2.0, and a final one featuring commentary by members of the cast and crew. English is the only spoken language option, but subtitles are provided in English for the hearing impaired. There are also extensive cast and crew biographies and filmographies, plus some DVD-ROM items. The keep case claims that the film was newly remastered in THX, but as far as I could tell in comparing it to its prior DVD incarnation, the picture and sound quality appear the same, with the anamorphic screen ratio an identical 2.17:1. Perhaps Artisan meant that the film was newly remastered for DVD previously. In any case, the picture and sound are still as good as could be hoped for and deserving of the highest rating that could be assigned them.Side two (B) is where you'll find most of the bonus materials. Again, navigation may be an initial problem, but once you think you get the hang of it, it becomes no easier. Here, in various categories, you will discover more than you could ever want to know about the film, its history, and its production. One of the subdivisions is called \"Information Programs,\" and it includes the disc's three main documentaries. The first is a thirty-minute promo titled \"The Making of T2,\" produced at the time of the film's shooting in 1991. You'll see interviews with the stars and crew and various behind-the-scenes looks at the techniques used in the filmmaking. The second, twenty-two-minute, featurette, made in 1993 for the Showtime cable channel and titled \"T2: More Than Meets the Eye,\" is even more interesting. It deals with the longer version of the movie and explains why certain scenes had to be cut for the original theatrical release and why they were filmed in the first place. The third documentary, the twenty-three-minute \"Making of Terminator 2 3D: Breaking the Screen Barrier,\" is all about the creation of the MCA/Universal Studios theme park attraction and hints that the attraction may be a stepping stone to a possible third theatrical feature. We'll see.Another subdivision on side two is called \"Visual Campaigns.\" It includes four trailers, three in partial widescreen and one in pan-and-scan, and five Japanese teasers. Then there's a third subdivision, called \"Data Hub,\" which has even more information. To begin with, it contains the complete shooting script of the film in 574 text frames. Placing the written text over a flaming red-and-orange backdrop, though, was a questionable decision. I didn't read the entire script, only the first few pages, but had I tried, I probably would have needed new glasses by now. (The DVD-ROM portion of the disc allows one to read the script while looking at many of the storyboards.) Next, there are what appear to be hundreds of regular storyboard sequences and archives. Tons and tons of archival stuff. In fact, there are sixty separate video selections, each individually indexed, probing the filmmaking process with cast and crew. Of these, I was particularly taken with the segments using multi-angle shots, the Terminator saying \"I'll be back\" in a variety of languages, and the sequence demonstrating the video transfer of \"T2\" for separate letterbox and pan-and-scan versions taken from the same Super-35 negative. And in yet another section, \"Data Core,\" you'll find fifty more chapters worth of supplemental items. Somewhere buried in all of these hours of bonus goods, there is supposed to be an article titled \"Battle Across Three Dimensions\" by Estelle Shay, but try as I might, I honestly couldn't find it. Next, if you have the patience, wait twenty seconds or so for a static menu screen to come to life and then click on it; you will be rewarded by a link to a not-so-hidden Web site. Finally, a thirty-two-page informational booklet insert may also set a record of sorts. You'll be exploring for weeks.Parting Thoughts:Without question, \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" the Ultimate Edition DVD, is well named. It is a milestone in the evolution of the DVD medium for its ability to carry huge quantities of information into the home. The movie itself looks and sounds as good as ever, and in its extended version it may even be a better story. This disc is an obvious must-buy, whether you own the earlier DVD or not.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the film?", "id": "5986dea96772e4a91d7ef8d74e61dff2", "answers": [{"text": "Three", "answer_start": 8927}]}]}, {"context": "This new &quot;Ultimate Edition DVD&quot; of Terminator 2 Judgement Day, one of the biggest box office smashes of all time, is truly The Ultimate Edition. Unless you get this outside of the US (which I did) you have two disks. One disk is the movie (THREE versions of the movie, in fact), and the next disk is all the special features. And it takes DAYS getting through every feature. I mean, three documentary, 8 trailers and TV spots, an entire script, interviews that you can access separately, and 52 chapters of behind the scenes footage, from makeup to visual effects, from editing to restoring deleted scenes. There are so many special features, this is what DVD was made for! You can also look at the original drawings of certain scenes, awesome!!!!However, I find the real highlight of this disk (or disks) to be the movie itself, I mean WOW!!! You get three, I repeat, three, versions of the movie. One is the original theatrical version, featuring no cut out scenes (the worst), the special edition, featuring 16 minutes of additional footage (second best) and the Extended Special Edition that you need a code for (the best) which features 18 minutes of additional footage, as well as an alternate ending. Here, now, I will give you a step-by-step description of how to get this extended special edition. I'm sure most of you people reading this know how to already, but this is for those who didn't know this version existed, or don't know how to get it. What you do is, you go to the features menu. It'll say &quot;Theatrical Version&quot; and &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Click on &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Then, you highlight &quot;Play Special Edition&quot; and type in (you may have to type ENTER in-between each number) EIGHT TWO NINE NINE SEVEN (8 2 9 9 7) and then, the &quot;Go To Theatrical Version&quot; option changes to &quot;Play Extended Special Edition&quot;. This is the definitive version of the movie. I believe that every single little, tiny scene that they cut out is in this version. Well, thats the code, now back to my review.The picture and audio on this disk are SO awesome, you won't believe it. Crystal clear picture, and sound so loud that it's like you're in a movie theatre. The additional, restored scenes are remastered as well, and slip perfectly into the movie. If you haven't even seen the film, you won't even notice these scenes put into it. Usually, on additional scenes, the picture is dirty and shakes. Not in these added scenes. And, to make it even better, the scenes are presented in 2:35:1 widescreen anamorphic format. Yes!! Just the first disk makes this DVD the ultimate edition!! Also, there's an audio commentary by 26 members of the cast and crew, however, this commentary is just interviews put together to sound like a commentary. However, there's a noticable glitch in the theatrical version, due to the commentary. Well, if you watch this commentary on one of the special editions, you'll notice it's the same commentary as the theatrical version, but they talk about deleted scenes as well. You may, also, notice that they continue talking about the deleted &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; at the hospital, when it goes into the next scene. So, now, when you watch the theatrical version, you'll notice that the beggining scene with Sarrah Connor watching the tape from six months ago, the beggining of the scene is cut off!!! Oops! Well, that's forgivible. Now, the second disk (or the second side of the disk) has lots of special features. The three documentarys include &quot;The Making Of Terminator 2 Judgement Day&quot;, &quot;T2 More Than Meets The Eye&quot;, where they talk about deleted sequences and the reason they were cut. The last is &quot;The Making Of Terminator 2 3-D Breaking The Screen Barrier&quot;, about the making of that 3-D terminator ride. I loved that ride (yes, I went on it) and this documentary is really interesting. The rest of the features, well, I'm not sure I kinow all of them. Maybe YOU should discover all the features on this disk. If you own the previous DVD release of T2 (which had no extras), then trash it and get this &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. You WON'T be dissipointed.If you found my review helpful, please be sure and vote for me!

One of the real surprises in this film is Mel Gibson's talent as a voice actor and *singer* - he's extremely good.  Gibson describes himself as a &quot;shower-only singer,&quot; and I think that is a real misnomer.Pocahontas has her amusing animal friends, Flit (the humming bird) and a truly humorous little raccoon whose name escapes me at the moment.  It is because of her friendship with these animals that she works so hard to convince John Smith (Gibson) of the importance of living in harmony with the land.I think the film carries a couple of good messages, along with its high entertainment value.  The first is, of course, to live in harmony with the land.  The second is that &quot;savage&quot; is often defined by which side of the line you happen to stand on - people often see those who are different as &quot;wrong.&quot;  &quot;Pocahontas&quot; goes a long way toward teaching young people the importance of shedding that viewpoint.", "qas": [{"question": "How good was the music?", "id": "7f198f0b5eca653340d4244f75e05210", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0788811355", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The movie is well done and nicely acted.

This was the film that the floundering Disney animation department had to prove themselves with... sink or swim quite literally.And the movie is a beauty! Inspired animation by greats like Ruben Aquino, Andreas Deja, and the legendary Glen Keane (who is directing the upcoming \"Rapunzel\"). The effects are stunning including a riveting storm sequence comparable to the Monstro scene in \"Pinocchio\" and the final sequence with the towering Ursula as queen of the seas. Sure its formulaic now, but the musical scenes are timeless and though \"Under the Sea\" is not as sophisticated as later animated \"showstoppers\" it still makes you see why the film's first audiences described wanting to stand up and cheer after the sequence.If you're any kind of animation buff (and even if you're not), the DVD's bonus features are great. The \"Making of\" featurette is quite thorough and takes you through the whole filmmaking process from the director's initial pitch to the studio bringing in Howard Ashman who fleshed out the characters with his witty lyrics to the final tense moments leading up to the premier in 1989. There's some great suprises here including interviews with John Waters (over Ursula being modeled on drag queen legend, Divine), and ex-Disney exec Jeffrey Katzenberg who stepped away from Dreamworks long enough to bring his insight on making \"Mermaid\" (and who, we find out almost nixed Ariel's anthem \"Part of Your World\" from the film).This film is inspiring to any wanna-be animator out there. Even more so, its a great film.

The picture quality is absolutely pristine.  The new lossless  7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is magnificent.  \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\" is highly recommended!For Walt Disney, seeing a play back in 1916 of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" based on the fairty tale by the Brothers Grimm definitely made the producer to attempt something that has never been done before and that is to create a full-length color animated film.Known for their \"Silly Symphony\" animated shorts, the 1937 animated film definitely silenced anyone who thought that Disney was not able to pull off a full-length animated feature.  Even Walt Disney's wife thought that no one would want to watch a film that starred dwarfs but needless to say, the film that was called \"Disney's Folly\" by naysayers would receive critical praise and even demand by fans for a sequel.  The film would be not only be a classic animated film which was honored by the American Film Institute as the \"Greatest Animation of All Time\".  Even today, adjusted by inflation, the film is considered one of the top 10 money making films in America of all time.In 2001, when the \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was released on DVD, the DVD was one of the films that were known for its innovation, winning a \"Video Premiere Award\" for \"Best Overall New Extra Features\" and nominated for \"Best DVD Menu Design\" and \"Best New, Enhanced or Reconstructed Movie Scenes\".But now in 2009, the film makes its High Definition entry on Blu-ray with 1080p High Definition picture quality and 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound.  Also, a Disney Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack (two Blu-ray discs and a DVD version of the film) which comes out on October 6,  seven weeks before its Deluxe Two-Disc Classic standard definition DVD which will be released on Nov. 24th.  It's also important to note that a limited edition collector's set will also be availableVIDEO & AUDIO:\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" gets its 1080p High Definition transfer and its absolutely beautiful.  Viewers can choose to watch the film in its original 4:3 (1:33:1)  format and watch it  with DisneyView featuring Tony Bluth's artwork on the side (for those who have widescreen televisions).  According to the guide included with this release, restoration experts took full advantage of the newest breakthroughs of digital imaging technologies to produce this classic.  The process took nearly a year of cleanup and scanning over 350,000 frames of the original 75-year-old negative.  And the digital artists then removed dust and scratches from the cels.The picture quality is absolutely beautiful for a film that is 72-years old.  The restoration and remastering has removed all dust and scratches.  I don't think I've seen any blemishes on video.  The picture quality is absolutely beautiful as art backgrounds just look absolutely divine. I don't think I have realized how exquisite the backgrounds were, especially the amount of emotion that went into the animation.  Picture quality for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\" is definitely magnificent and I look forward to seeing Disney continue this trend of remastering their classic animated films.  As for DisneyView, similar to \"Pinocchio\", Toby Bluth's painted borders that are on the sides of the animation matches the animation quite fine and was definitely my preference over standard black bars.As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is featured in an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.Audio is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), the original mono presentation and also French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT restored original theatrical soundtrack.  The film is dialogue and music driven with the soundtrack being front and center channel driven.  Music is also featured during the surround and rear surround channels as well.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and understandable.  During the more emotional sequences, such as Snow White running away from home in the forest, definitely makes the room quite immersive, albeit a short while but overall, a good use of utilizing the music of Snow White through all channels.  There are other parts that really come through on all channels such as a shriek by Snow White coming clear from the rear surrounds which was quite nice (and surprising).  Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack for a 72-year old animated film.As for the audio of the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT soundtrack.Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\" is absolutely loaded with special features.

Needless to say, the DVD won several awards for its technology and so, when the announcement came that \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" will receive a Diamond Edition Blu-ray disc release, I was curious to see how Disney could top themselves because that release was already phenomenal.I have since gone through the Blu-ray release and all I can say is...Wow!Disney has not only topped the Platinum Edition release, they have set the bar once again for a Blu-ray release and the amount of content that can be included on a Blu-ray and let alone, how awesome they were able to digitally restore the classic 1937 film.There was no doubt in my mind that Disney would give their first animated feature on Blu-ray the best treatment as possible and as this release is a celebration of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", it's also a celebration of the talent behind the film.  Those who were involved with Hyperion Studios that created the \"Silly Symphonies\" animated shorts back in the early 1930's and using the technology at that time and building it, in order to create their first full feature animated masterpiece.In fact, not only do we get audio of those who worked on the film but we also are treated with those classic animated shorts such as \"Babes in the Woods\", \"The Skeleton Dance\", \"Music Land\", \"Goddess of Spring\", \"Playful Pluto\", \"The Old Mill\", \"Steamboat Willie\" and more.  And to make things even more impressive, these shorts are featured in HD (not cleaned up but still much better than their DVD counterparts). This Blu-ray release manages to capture the various process of the film from creating the story, the music, the art, the backgrounds, the layout, the animation, the live action references, decisions at the sweatbox meetings, ink and paint and how women were involved in the animated process at the time, the camera department, soundstage, etc.So much is included on both Blu-ray discs in terms of special features, so much went into restoring this film, that this release is one, if not the top video releases of all time.  I have no doubt in my mind that probably ten years from now, this Blu-ray will be highly revered for its content.I know that many people own the 2001 Platinum DVD Edition of \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and are wondering if it's worth the double dip and the answer is YES!  There is just so much included on the Diamond Edition, way more than the 2001 Platinum Edition.  Also, if you are now wanting these classic Disney films in High Definition, its definitely worth the move to see this classic film in High Definiton.  But I must say that you should not toss away your 2001 DVD edition because there are video clips such as the \"Excerpt from The Story of Silly Symphony\", \"Excerpt from Tricks of Our Trade\", \"Camera Tests\", \"Abandoned Concepts\", vintage audio (radio shows and spots are not included) and several songs and deleted scenes which are not included on this Diamond Edition release.So, overall it's a no-brainer that \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\" is definitely worth it.  For High Definition fans, the film looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  And as mentioned, the sheer amount of content included in this release is absolutely incredible.I really don't have any negatives but me being nitpicky that it would have been nice to have certain special features such as the vintage radio/audio content , a few deleted scenes, songs and video clip excerpts from the 2001 Platinum Edition DVD included on the Diamond Edition.  And personally, for me that is the only thing that prevents me from calling this release absolute perfection.  There was one other thing and that is my Blu-ray discs came in a black DVD case, not the standard blue casing.  I was told that there will be two releases (in different casing, not inc. the limited edition) with one in a blue Blu-ray case and another using black DVD casing in order to educate those new to Blu-ray.I do think that Diamond Edition and the Platinum Edition are quite different in terms of presentation of special features and the goals were quite different of what kind of special features would be presented.  With the Platinum Edition, its solely focused on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and in the Diamond Edition, there is more focus on giving the viewer the history of Walt Disney and the animators of how they got from Silly Symphonies to using their skills and technology in creating the first animated feature film.  So, as I have said earlier in my review, this release is more or less, a celebration of those who worked on the film and giving recognition to those animators and staff members who took part in that film and the work that they did earlier, that became instrumental in creating Snow White.So, overall...the Diamond Edition is just incredible when it comes to the actual digital restoration of this classic film and a release that is absolutely packed with special features.  \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition\" is a solid release that raises the bar of what Disney is capable of in terms of content in a home video release.  This is truly a magnificent release and is highly recommended!", "qas": [{"question": "What story is classic?", "id": "bddc0c8834fdac8c02afe97e858f0892", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0788832182", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from this movie.

I was thoroughly entertained,  the characters were indeed different enough from other movies and the plot was not a rehashed story.  All though there have been plenty of &quot;alien&quot; stories the characters here were original and fresh and the setting of Kauai, Hawaii gave it a  flavor all its own.My sister told me she cried a couple of times watching this.  I am not that easily moved, yet I understand why she felt the emotions she did.  This movie made it's statement by getting the viewer involved in the life of a little girl and not trying to make some some big political statements like many kids movies have.  We weren't asked to feel bad about people going to war, chopping down trees or ruining some native civilization.  We are just shown a little girl in a tough setting and how she deals with life.When she meets the other star of the film, Stitch, the fun begins and the two get into lots of trouble.  The story is basic enough that it is still fun and entertaining for the young, yet has enough going for it that it will be enjoyed by adults as well.In my house the 20 month old rules the DVD player and a movie that is good by her standards get played over and over.

It is a wonderfully imaginative and compelling story, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the new film is very faithful to its source.  I think longtime fans of the \"Narnia\" book series will appreciate the film's respect for C.S. Lewis's writings, and even those not familiar with the series should enjoy the exciting film.The film's special effects (of which there are many) are some of the best of 2005, making the talking animals and mythical creatures in Narnia completely convincing (instead of distracting).  However, I was the most surprised by how good the film's acting was.  Tilda Swinton is deliciously evil as the White Witch, but the real surprise came from the acting abilities of the four central children, who really seem like siblings onscreen.  Especially noteworthy is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy, the youngest of the siblings.  Henley's performance is wonderful throughout the film, winning over the audience without ever becoming cutesy.  It's a shame the three main \"Harry Potter\" kids were not this strong in the first of their films (though they have improved with each installment).I definitely recommend seeing \"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\" and I hope they make more \"Narnia\" films soon.  If this first film is any indication, the series could be a worthy successor to the now-completed \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the movie?", "id": "5e06d8c065f0a0c806f67f121e736035", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I love all the books.  I have read them to my children several times.  The movie is very close to the book.  What helps to accept the slight changes made is the control Donald Grishem had over the project.  We bought the DVD with the extra bonus material on it - it is well worth it.  My boys enjoy watching the bonus material as much as the movie.  It helps explain why the movie, the director made a few slight changes from the book.  These slight changes only enhanses the story.  I am amazed at the pettiness of some viewers who are upset over the slightest detail not being exactly like the book. Regardless of the changes, it is a beautiful movie that captures the essence of CS Lewis' masterpiece.  The musical score is perfect, moving, thrilling!  I am a musician and I am picky about film scores.  I'm not very happy about the music for the credits, though.  It does seem a little out of place.  But that's all.  As for Aslan's voice, Aslan is three dementional, therefore it is important that he not sound like Darth Vader.  Liam does a tender, commanding, and emotional portrayal of Aslan. The children are very good, spontaneous, refreshing.  Peter holds the four children together as we see him grow from his insecurities into a king.  There have been some complaints that Susan is too mean.  Susan is not mean, however the actress needed to portray her such that it is no surprise in the later books when Susan chooses not to believe in such childish things, therefore, never going back to Narnia.  It works well in the movie.  The spirit of Narnia lives in this movie and in all the characters, actors, and crew who worked hard to make it live.  One must feel somewhat sorry for others so wrapped up in the letter of Narnia that they do not catch or feel the spirit of Narnia.  I think Aslan would just shake his head in wonderment.  As far as CS Lewis - I feel strongly he would approve of his masterpiece and would be thrilled with the slight changes, especially the end.  CS Lewis believed in the spirit of Narnia and had no ego regarding his work.To appreciate the White Witch you need to read Magician's Nephew.  The director portrayed her perfectly.  On the bonus material of the DVD, the director mentioned that he avoided a typical female villan such as wicked witch, evil queen.  Therefore he went for someone unexpected.  She was internally demonic and quietly seething which made her role more evil instead of playing her over the top.  The battle scene is her forte.  She is Jadis - tall, strong and twisted.As far as Disney - Disney marketed the film, but they were restricted from offering advice or making changes to the production.  This is marketed through Disney, but it is not a Disney film.  Big difference.  When others state it is a typical Disney film, they are mistaken.  Some complain that the characters are stock with the typical Disney villan and happy Disney ending.  Good grief, read the book!Now, for those true Narnia lovers - Focus On The Family has all of the Narnia stories recreated in a radio theater format with  actors, orchestrations and sound effects.  We have all of them and my boys, 16 and 12, still listen to them weekly.  It is a wonderful way to get to know the other books as well.Life's too short to miss out on Narnia.

Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" with its seven allegorical books is becoming the latest film franchise. This first movie based upon the second book in the series is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures like centaurs, satyrs, fauns, gryphons, dwarfs, a wicked albino witch, and four charming and innocent British school kids. The movie is entertaining, but it does not seem to resonate with any great significance or meaning despite Lewis's reputation as a Christian polemicist.The four siblings who have been evacuated from the London blitz during War II are staying with a rich man in his country mansion. The youngest, a girl, travels to the snowy land of Narnia by entering a magic wardrobe. She meets a faun and the wicked witch.

Last night I watched it again, loving it as much as I did the first time.Reading the book [and subsequently The Road], I thought Cormac McCarthy had finally let go of his literary pretensions and desire to take up Faulkner's mantle and had come into his own in both these spare, lyrical and powerful late works. The Coens have also matured as filmmakers and interpreted his work beautifully in this neo-western.In 1980, Llewellyn Moss [ Josh Brolin], a survivor of two tours of duty in Viet Nam, is hunting in the desert when he stumbles across the remnants of a bloody shoot-out in a large drug sale gone wrong. Scoping the scene, he picks up a suitcase filled with two million dollars, which he believes will be his salvation [ he and his wife, Carla-Jean live on the edge of poverty in a dilapidated old trailer]. With this action, he sets into motion a series of events which will cause him to go on the run from both psychotic hitman Anton Chiguhr and  bounty hunter Carson Wells [Woody Harrelson], who is sent  by the cartel when they realize Chiguhr is out of control.Perhaps Moss overestimates his own abilities, but he believes he can prevail over his fate as his story narrows on a cross country chase to Mexico. The movie then shifts to world weary sheriff Ed Tom Bell [Tommy Lee Jones] who, while speculating on the nature of evil and violence,  desires both to help Moss and apprehend Chiguhr.Bell sees something happening as a pall of darkness falls across the land and as life, which was so comfortable and secure  in the postwar era, changes, once again reverting to the brutality and chaos that has always pervaded the West since time immemorial. The empty and dry landscape enforces his feelings of doom as Moss, the quintessential working man, who has evaded death in battle, now faces Death in the inconceivable and primeval form of Chigurh. Along the way, the story becomes bigger than itself, and bigger than the story of the last days of America, as it strips itself down to survival and the nature of life itself, bloody and raw.Brilliant direction -- the off scene violence and open end were beautifully done- and the performances by Jones, Bardem, McDonald [ Carla-Jean], and particularly Brolin who has always reminded me of a slower, rawer Kris Kristofferson were outstanding.  Highly recommended.", "qas": [{"question": "How good is the screen time?", "id": "85fd99158c4b92600330977b69fc680b", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I refrained from seeing No Country for Old Men for a good few months. I didn't go to the cinema to watch it and I waited a day or so once I rented it. I was not overly eager to see it as I had a feeling I was going to be underwhelmed. Even with the Oscar and the glittering critical acclaim, I just knew it wouldn't be anything special and I was right.There was a time when I was a big Coen's fan but I feel like I have outgrown them if that's the right word. I remember as a film student being wowed by their films' quirkiness, style and cleverness. However, I now find myself wanting more from a `good' film, for example, real emotional involvement, psychological realism e.g. the characters behaving as they probably would were they real people, characters that show development or different sides to them. This has always been the Coen's biggest weakness - providing characters that we really care about, that are interesting in more ways than just being fun to watch because of their exaggerated mannerisms. Barton Fink was an exception, John Turturro was amazing and we sort of cared for him and Francis McDormand in Fargo and Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski were similar but even then, there was always an element of cartoonishness about them. I find myself agreeing more and more with those reviewers who were always more reserved in their appreciation of the Coen's, citing their works as placing more importance in the style rather than the content.Why does Bardem's killer use the cattle stun gun? He's shown us that he's more than willing to use a silenced shotgun to do his dirty work so why lug around this huge bulky chunk of metal? It's no quieter or less messy than his shotgun. I haven't read the book so I don't know whether it is a Coen invention but it seems to be nothing more than a shallow stylistic device. Again with Bardems 60's style bobbed hair style - this must surely be a Coen invention since they have a history of adorning their characters with bizarre hairstyles - again it is nothing more than a shallow stylistic device to say, `look, this is a Coen film'! And some of the dialogue! For instance, the much quoted line where Brolin's character asks his wife to tell his mum he loves her if he doesn't return - yes it's very snappy dialogue but exists for no other reason than that and would only really work if we were to believe that a man had forgotten his mother had died. Hmmm.No Country is a good film. It is enjoyable and there are some decent set pieces where the tension and suspense is quite high and it's good to see the Coen's exercising some restraint but apart from the `indie' ending, there is nothing really to separate it from any other high end Hollywood thriller but the critics will have you believe it is something so much more. It isn't and don't let the injections of an old man's musings or a killer's deterministic speeches make you think it is.In fact, how can the film really be about the changing face of America or fate - these are huge grand themes and ones that would benefit from a very different sort of approach. Perhaps something more akin to a multi stranded approach like the way Crash dealt with racism - something that justifies or `proves' its message by using an assortment of situations and relations. Taking a small crime story that really focuses on three men and saying this represents worldly change is stretching it to say the least. And then the story shoots itself in the foot and contradicts itself completely towards the end when Tommy Lee Jones' character visits his uncle and his uncle relays him the story of a violent past event way back in 1901, the point being that the world has always been a violent place and it is not getting worse as the poor sheriff thinks!So what is the film trying to say??? One minute it seems to suggest the world is becoming increasingly hostile and the next minute it says that it's always been like this! I remember Seven played around with the same theme.I actually liked the ending, I thought it was nicely understated and shows how things can fizzle out and be left unresolved. I didn't care to know whether or not Bardem killed the wife, because it wasn't at all important to the story (although I feel the Coen's may have given a clue e.g . Bardem checks the soles of both his shoes as he leaves the house, perhaps checking for blood stains? - it doesn't really matter anyhow).A previous reviewer compared No Country to The Terminator and I would agree. No Country is basically a suspenseful genre movie about a man being chased by a seemingly unstoppable killer (there's even a scene where he `repairs' himself). Yes the acting, injections of wit and cinematography are up to the usual high Coen's standards but I personally didn't find the film to be exhilarating or refreshing or particularly deep and meaningful.

This says a lot for the writer, directors, actors and others involved.  The film is not as quirky as the Coens' previous work, but then, it's not that kind of tale.  It almost plays out in some ways like a classic Western, but is set in 1980 and does not give us easy resolutions. For this reason, some will complain that the ending isn't satisfying because it does not tie up all loose ends, because the villain walks away, because so many others die even if they were innocent and weren't involved in any crimes.I found the ending quite refreshing, however.  This is not formula.  This is how things often happen in real life, which is messy and can cause a lot of disillusionment.This connects to the sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, who comes to realize that he cannot stop what is going to happen no matter what he does, and that he is no longer able to deal with the modern world, which is very different from the world he grew up in (apparently, everything went down the tubes when people stopped saying \"sir\" and \"ma'am\").  That's where the title comes from:  it's not a world that people of his generation can inhabit any longer, and the existential crisis and realization cause him to retire.On to the performances:  aside from the rock-solid Jones, we have Javier Bardem, the coolly eerie, unblinking psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh, who can kill with an oxygen tank without ever beating people over the head with it, but who tries to keep from stepping in blood.  And there is the superb Josh Brolin as Llewellyn Moss, a man who makes the fatal error of trying to take a large sum of money that he never should have touched in the first place.The almost complete lack of music during the movie contributes to the creepiness factor as well, as does the desolate yet somehow beautiful landscape.Look for nominations next year.", "qas": [{"question": "Is this character avaliable in your store?", "id": "062ef2716eb1d484d8826ed426a808d3", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0790701251", "paragraphs": [{"context": "While `Full Metal Jacket' is a Vietnam War film, don't go in looking for another `Platoon'. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the key to understanding `Full Metal Jacket' is to realise that this is a Kubrick film first and a war film second. Both boot camp and battlefield merely serve as a backdrop for the usual Kubrick themes and ideas, and the final product bears more similarity to `Clockwork Orange' than to other war movies.Being a Stanley Kubrick film, it goes without saying that the technical aspects of `Full Metal Jacket' are almost flawless. Kubrick makes excellent use of pans, long shots, close-ups, and point-of-view, and some of the battle scenes in the second half are given realism by the use of hand-held camerawork. Kubrick also does a good job in set design; using a British army base to substitute for US Marine boot camp was a no-brainer, but amazingly a dilapidated London gasworks was very realistically transformed into the Vietnamese city of Hue.As has been often noted, the film is split into two parts, and in some ways is almost two independent films. The first half, dealing with Marine boot camp, is exceptional. R Lee Emery's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is terrifyingly realistic, and has to be seen to be believed. His interactions with his \"maggots\", especially his relentless abuse of Private Pyle, are at once hilarious and disturbing. And Vincent Donofrio as the misfit-turned-psychopath Pyle is also outstanding.However, the brilliance of the first half means the second part of the film can fall a bit flat. One big problem is that Hartman and Pyle are the two most interesting characters in the movie, but are absent from the second half, meaning Joker has to carry this part of the film. But Joker is a fairly weak protagonist; he seems designed as an \"everyman\" that we can identify with, but his very ordinariness means he is often overshadowed by more interesting characters such as Hartman, Pyle, and (in the second half) Animal Mother. He's really just a pair of eyes through which we see the war and its effects on men.One way in which `Full Metal Jacket' differs from other war films is that it doesn't have an explicit message. In typical Kubrick fashion, he refuses to settle for easy answers; he presents the characters and events as they are, and forces us to draw our own conclusions. On one hand, the absence of any \"pass the bucket\" flag-waving or preachy anti-war posturing is a welcome relief. But on the other, the rather detached and academic approach of the film can make it difficult to engage with. While there are some powerful scenes, `Full Metal Jacket' lacks the nightmarish feel of `Apocalypse Now', or the strong emotional pull of something like `The Deer Hunter'.In all, `Full Metal Jacket' is a typical Kubrick film, so if you've seen any of his other movies, you'll probably already know whether you'll love it or hate it. Those expecting a gung-ho action fest or a film with a clear \"point\" might be disappointed, but open-minded war movie fans should find this a unique and challenging take on Vietnam.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the film ?", "id": "9c2de5c3ace85f8fcfd7956f8319b70e", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0790705141", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I'm sorry, but I think &quot;The Shining&quot; is a completely overrated horror film.

Both story and character development are compromised by the dazzling but dull visual details that Kubrick brings to the table.

Blade Runner looks and sounds like a state of the art film. The entire print was digitized and special effects footage was scanned in at 8000 lines per frame. The new sound production quality is quite simply an Oscar worthy effort and the images are as clean as a whistle and sharpened to a razor.The story revolves around Blade Runners, which means they are licensed to kill androids, who are given assignments to retire these illegal skin-jobs if they try to escape captivity from off-world colonies and integrate themselves in with society. Four replicants are on the loose and Blade Runner Deckard must hunt them down through a dystopian city.Ridley Scott's art direction is probably the best the big screen has ever seen which is startling considering that the film is over 25 years old. The film achieved cult status on video after being panned by the critics (many of whom have reversed their position since). The SF author Philip K. Dick died before he could see his book come to life and since then other directors such as Steven Spielberg have filmed his material.So what's new in Blade Runner: The Final Cut?(1) The first meeting between Gaff and Deckard is shorter.(2) Bryant mentions four skin jobs and not five.(3) Some extra crowd shots.(4) The unicorn dream sequence is extended.(5) The snake seller scene has been correctly synced.(6) Deckard meets a policeman before the Snake Pit.(7) Two exotic dancers.(8) Zhora's display case crash has been completely redone.(9) Swear words have been removed from the Tyrell Batty meeting.(10) The Tyrell murder sequence is uncut.

Many of his other earlier films, including BEETLEJUICE (1988), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1993), ED WOOD (1994), and ironically BATMAN RETURNS (1992) are 100% TIM BURTON! They are all great in that Burtonesque way. While Burton's first Batman film BATMAN has obvious Burton touches: odd and disturbing characters, dark tone, neo-noirish look, the film still manages to be generally accessible to the mass audience. It moves at a fast, breezy pace and has an epic, Hollywood feel to it, with a satisfying conclusion. But that, in this case, is not a bad thing! I have re-watched this entertaining flick so many times it isn't funny! It just works. Can't say that for many of the superhero films in this new PC, uninspired generation of films.I actually saw BATMAN (1989) when it first came out in movie theatres and was blown away by it's originality and scope...still am. Even more so now since it holds up 20+ years later as great entertainment. In retrospect, Michael Keaton was the perfect choice to play the fractured, flawed antiheroic Bruce Wayne AKA Batman. But I always felt he was the right choice! Keaton captures the guarded loneliness of the Bruce Wayne character, while still being very convincing as a tough guy who can hold his own when donning the cape and cowl! Mr. Burton...you made the right choice!The other inspired (and perhaps more obvious) choice was casting the legendary Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier AKA The Joker. Nicholson is convincing as high-level \"yes man\" thug Napier who through a nasty accident becomes facially scarred and assumes the Joker persona. And Nicholson really looks like The Joker in this! He has so many memorable lines that I think about all the time. The hero-villain chemistry between he and Keaton is electric.Kim Basinger (at her most gorgeous!) admirably plays nosy photojournalist Vicki Vale, who arrives in Gotham City to unlock the secret of the mysterious Caped Crusader who has been \"terrorizing\" low level criminals throughout the city. She ends up falling in love with Bruce Wayne (lucky bastard!). Basinger is the weakest link of the main actors, but she still does a good job of emoting, being simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by Batman and Joker's antics. She screams a lot, but look at the freaks she's dealing with! Can you blame her?The solid supporting cast includes Michael Gough (wonderful turn as Alfred, Bruce's ever-so-reliable and dependable butler and caretaker), Robert Wuhl (in an energetic turn as Vicki's fellow reporter Alex Knox), Billy Dee Williams (as DA Harvey Dent), and Pat Hingle (as world-weary Police Commissioner Gordon). In particular, Keaton and Gough have an effortless chemistry as though they have been close their whole lives. Gough came back for Schumacher's cartoonish campy films and he had none of the chemistry with either Kilmer or Clooney that he had with Keaton in the Burton ones. It was weird watching Gough's Alfred interact with those tepid versions of Bruce Wayne.As previously stated, I am amazed at how Burton's style fused perfectly with more conventional Hollywood touches and created something special out of it. It could have been a monumental failure, but instead ended up being a template for all future superhero films.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the film?", "id": "2b8fdd696a25f21365ed9b4d4fdc7601", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0790729725", "paragraphs": [{"context": "There is a moment in Goodfellas when you realize how mad being a gangster is.---SPOILER ALERT--- (A tiny one, but always worth throwing that out there)The scene where Lorraine Bracco is sitting on Ray Liotta's chest pointing a snub nose revolver at his face and demanding him to be faithful to her that you realize: Whoa, someone lived through this?That about sums up Goodfellas.

At no point did I see any aliasing or stair stepping either.  The colors, despite some obvious but deliberate bleach bypassing during post production, are true to life and not too deeply saturated as often films are.  There are many dark and shadowy  scenes in this film but details are not lost at all.  This is one film that was truly remastered during the process of updating it to blu ray.The audio is equally excellent with a new DTS MA 7.1 lossless audio.  The difference between the lossless and lossy audio is significant if you have a decent home theater system.  While my system is currently a 5.1 system, the use of the discreet channels for both the front and rear stages is just plain sweet.  The soundtrack/score envelopes you throughout the film and the foley fx are not just steered towards the front stage, the rear's are also used a great deal with the sub LFE channel doing its job contributing.  This has got to be one of the most worked over audio transfers on any Blu Ray disc, really fine.The menu for 'Seven' is the only thing that really was poor.  The contrast between what you have selected or not is barely susceptible to the eyes and I had a very difficult time navigating through the many extras.

Because technical skill is not enough - the film must be worthwhile viewing and certainly must not let me down at the end.The good points: Director Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji  deserve special mention for making the film dark, moody, and of exactly the right pitch for the material.  Although I couldn't tell on my system (I don't have surround sound), I'm told that the sound itself is worth the price of the DVD.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfect, as is the &quot;guest star&quot; serial killer, whose name I won't reveal because it's a neat surprise (his name is not given in the opening credits so it's not for me to reveal his name, although other reviews do).  The idea is creative - a serial killer &quot;sermon&quot; on the deadly sins.  Many have commented on how disturbing the film is, which is true, but not any more so than some true story serial killers, and I would have no problem recommending the film to others (but take the R-rating very seriously!)However....  At the end of the film, for all its technical skill, I was not left with the impression that the experience was worthwhile.  The more I thought about it, the less I liked the ending and the protrayal of the serial killer.  Some of the murders (e.g. greed and sloth) are grisly, but not really poetic justice.  Likewise, the ending is very irritating.  Not so much for its predictability, but for the fact that it cheats.  Count up the number of murders at the end, and you don't get seven.  I have other objections, but they would require revealing too much, so I won't post them here.Seven is one of these moody pieces where the audience is jerked around but where it should all come together at the end.  Think about two films with some of the same stars, namely 12 Monkeys and The Usual Suspects: the endings of these films are consistent with the buildup and don't cheat the audience.  Seven does cheat, so it loses status in my star rating.The DVD edition is quite a good package.  There are 4 audio commentaries, although most of them (and many of the other extras) are technical in nature.  One entire commentary is devoted to the sound alone!  My favourite extra - cut and/or alternate scenes - is interesting, especially the original opening sequence of the film and the subplot it generated.

It was made to be intentionally camp, keeping with the spirit of the time in which it was produced. The series also faithfully adapted the comic book source material as it was during the time period; just read a Batman comic from 1966 if you don't believe me. This being stated, I am not anxious to see something of a similar tone done on Batman again.In 1997, after almost three decades of Batman being returned to his earlier roots as an urban vigilante in the pages of the monthly comics, some out of touch creative decision making lead to this disaster of a film which takes Batman back to the camp era but without the wit or respect for the source material, or the intelligence of the audience for that matter.The script is composed entirely of one-liners, which screen writer Akiva Goldman still feels was appropriate, while Joel Schumacher throws away all his credibility as a director of note and talent by selling out to make what can only be called garbage. It's hard to believe this movie was made by the same person who directed well crafted thrillers like the Client, A Time to Kill, and Falling Down.The villains of the film, Poison Ivey (Uma Thurman) and Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger), are as toothless as the come. They ooze about as much menace as a pair of bunny rabbits. While Bane, a criminal genius in the comics, is made into a brute as mindless as the film itself. Not content to squander these three classic villains, the script throws in a fourth for good measure in the form of the Floranic Man (played by John Glover).As one of the writers of the old TV show remarked; One Shark is worth a hundred Barracudas\", following this advice would have made this film far less top heavy with characters vying for audience attention.On the other side of the spectrum, George Clooney plays a great Bruce Wayne, but the awful script lets him down at every turn and his performance is squandered. Chris O'Donnell also suffers from the same problem. He shows up ready to do a great job, but has nothing to work with and spends most of the movie complaining and acting like a brat.This is all the more tragic as the film is called \"Batman and Robin\", but the focus is shifted from showcasing the duo to introduce Batgirl, played by Alicia Silverstone in one very poorly conceived role.With the exception of Michael Gough's performance as Alfred, the film is devoid of any emotional hook or narrative, and there is nothing for the audience to relate to.

Between the draining investigation, Bullitt struggles to maintain his relationship with his cultured, sensitive girlfriend, Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset)Primarily coming from a TV series background, Englishman Peter Yates (directing his fourth movie) did a commendable job as director on \"Bullitt\"...producing a complex, intense crime thriller with a unique style that would ultimately influence many other films.

Film directors can't hide the flaws of a noir behind big explosions, car chases or visual effects. \"L.A. COnfidential\" probably isn't for everyone because it combines the film noir genre with a solid mystery and strong dramatic performances.Set in Los Angeles during the early 1950's, \"L.A. Confidential\" opens with a bang quite literally--Three very different detectives the by-the-book golden boy Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), the hard nosed violent Bud White (Russell Crowe) and the celebrity obsessed Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey)try and unravel the conspiracy behind a seemingly random shotgun slaying at a popular diner and how it is tied into the murders of organized crime kingpin Mickey Cohen's gang. The three detectives make a reluctant team hoping to solve the crime and achieve their own personal agendas in the process. They also must find out how Lynn Bracken (Kim Bassinger) a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake and a cavalcade of other hookers made up to look like Hollywood stars figure into all of this.Well directed by Curtis Hansen from a terrific script by Brian Helgeland and Hansen that manages to adapt James Ellroy's novel without betraying its story or atmosphere, \"L.A. Confidental\" was nominated for a bucket load of Oscars winning two for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Bassinger). The entire cast is terrific from Crowe to Danny DeVito who plays Sid Huggins the editor of the scandal rag L.A. Confidential. Spacey plays oily Vincennes with confidence and style while Crowe embodies the brutal force of Bud White. Pearce who plays Exley the son of a highly regarded murdered police officer gives depth to a character that could easily have been cookie cutter.The Blu-ray looks positively stunning particularly. How does this look in comparison to the 1998 original DVD release? There's greater detail and sharpnes. The original DVD was one of the best transfers of its era (and still holds up remarkably well). The new DVD also looks sharper but the Blu-ray manages to capture the golden cinematography Oscar nominated Dante Spinotti perfectly.We get a great mix of previously released extras ported over from the first \"Special Edition\" when DVDs were still being released in snapcases to some stunning brand new ones as well. The best here is the audio compilation of comments by the director, cast and crew. Although it isn't as fascinating as a scene specific commentary track, it allows each important member of the creative team to give their thoughts on shooting the film, the characters and the story.\"Whatever You Desire\" is a brand new 30 minute documentary on the making of the film. \"Sunlight to Shadows\" another new extra focuses on the cinematography. \"The Cast\" is pretty self explanatory focuses on the seven main characters and two relative \"unknowns\"-Pearce and Crowe. \"From Book to Screen\" gives us Hansen and Helgland discussing the difficulty of translating Ellroy's terrific novel to the screen without sacrificing too much of the story or characters. We also get two very neat extras--\"L.A. Confidential\" a 2003 pilot for a TV series that was to star Keifer Sutherland and a second disc that gives us a sampler of the soundtrack featuring the following songs: Johnny Mercer and the Pied Pipers -- \"Ac-Cent-tchu-ate The Positive\"Chet Baker -- \"Look for the Silver Lining\"Betty Hutton -- \"Hit the Road to Dreamland\"Kay Starr -- \"Wheel of Fortune\"Jackie Gleason -- \"But Not For Me\"Dean Martin -- \"Powder Your Face With SunshineThe DVD set has three discs if you count the sampler while the Blu-ray has two.

We were a group of five relatives and everyone had different tastes in film.  We finally decided to try this movie without much hope of anyone being too happy, but instead every single person loved it.  It is a thriller and a romance and a tale of good versus evil.  Set in 1950s Los Angeles and based to a small degree on actual events, this tale of corruption in Hollywood and the LAPD, with 80 speaking parts and 45 locations, deservedly won many awards. The cast is fantastic -- amazing that two young Australian actors held their own against veterans James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito -- but Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe made their big American splash with this film; Kim Basinger does her best work here, and the supporting cast is flawless.  Director Curtis Hanson preserves some of the elements of the traditional film noir, like voiceover, plot twists and hidden motives, while updating others, such as the use of more natural lighting and a more character-driven story.DVD extras are plentiful and fun.  The soundtrack is in English or French, the subtitles in English, French or Spanish; there is also a music only soundtrack.  Extra features include: cast and crew credits; text and pictures covering the characters of Dragnet and Bloody Christmas, 1951 -- an event similar to that in the film; prices for various items in 1953; awards the film won; three television ads and a film trailer; a fun interactive map of 1950s LA; the screen tests of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe; a 19-minute featurette, \"Off the Record\", with cast and crew interviews; and the 18-photos used by Curtis Hanson to visualize the project and to pitch the film to the producer and actors.This is a terrific film and the many DVD extras make this edition even more attractive.

I was quite surprised when I first watched Casablanca to find that I practically could already quote the last ten minutes. So much of this film is engrained into our cultural consciousness from the countless spoofs and references that have come since then. And for good reason.In World War II, Casablanca is the place where displaced refugees find themselves in. Getting out is the hard part. A cynical American, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular gin joint there. Things are going good for him as he deigns to keep out of business that doesn't concern him. That all changes when a French underground leader, Victor Lazslo (Paul Henreid), comes to town with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). It seems that Rick and Ilsa have a past together, and with the Nazis looking for some transit papers Rick happens to have and also trying to detain Victor, Rick finds himself in a tough spot.After watching this I realized that's there's nothing staggeringly original or innovative about this film. It's how human the characters and the plights they find themselves in are, and the dry humor they throw out in the process. The conflict inside Rick whether to look after his best interests or help the woman he still loves is certainly compelling stuff, but that isn't all. There are so many memorable characters, from the ingratiating Captain Renault (played with relish by Claude Reins) to the weasely Ugarte (Peter Lorre). While the story isn't so much about Casablanca, a little bit of everything is worked in. Not the least of which being the sticky politics and smoldering national pride for Nazi occupied France. The romance is also ... well, the reason why this movie is so timeless. And then there's the script. Though there are numerous lines that are justifiably classic, the rest is a rare work of brilliance as well. The dark humor, the slow eroding of Rick's resolve, all result in classic scenes, one after another. It has it all.Bogart and Bergman, a rare pairing that results in one of cinema's greatest romances. What more is there to say? They take what could have been completely conventional roles and make them truly human. A great supporting cast rounds out the crowd; there are more than just two memorable performances given.

The underlying premise being that we can ultimately be in control of our own lives and destiny if we will just get past all of the b.s. that society and particularly the government put upon us.  If you'll notice there are multiple refernces to the inherent evil of the tax system (IRS) and the accepted standards of career development and obeying you 'superiors' rather than following your own inner voice.  But what I particularly enjoyed is when Morpheus states that most people are not ready (and I would add that they're ill equipped) to think for themselves and not be a slave to the system or the false nature of the society in which we live.  And as such, the vast majority of society is the enemy of those who really know the truth.  Our entire educational system (the perfect example) is set up to prepare people not to be individuals but rather automatons answering the bell and following the herd while making wealthy, fulfilled, and happy people out of the few who can see beyound the smoke screen.There's also a very spiritual undercurrent to the film.  To me the film makes the case that within us all there is a power that is far greater than we could ever imagine.  We just have to learn to tap into it (believe) and become our true actualized selves.  As Morpheus states there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.  But very few of us will ever even know the path let alone even endeavor to walk the path.  But it is there within all of us to know and walk.  As Neo says the choice is up to you.The most powerful and important idea expressed though is that whatever your mind believes is ultimately reality.  Also the concept that the data your mind is fed in either a conscious or unconscious state will be accepted and believed holds tremendous promise for more enlightened and truly powerful individuals.  That is if you're willing to let go of all the crap you've been spoon fed all of your life and willing to begin to feed yourself that which truly nourishes your mind.The story is awesome, the special effects are beyond belief, the action is fantastic and the premise is not as sci-fi or far fetched as may be commonly believed.", "qas": [{"question": "How good is the action?", "id": "499b34ae5759430d88c4545932a6af2b", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "well wasn't I disapointed when I went to the video store last October to find that one of my favorite movies wasn't going to be released on VHS for another 3 months!

I bought it because this movie is one of the most recent and truest milestones in the story of cinema. And it's funny, because when the movie was released, back in 1999, it was not an instant success. I remember thinking (at the time): \"The world-dominated-by-machines plot, and starring Keanu Reeves - I will not waste my money and my time\". Now I regret not having watched it in the theatre.The plot is not original. It has been used in many science fiction movies, books, comics and so on. The machines have revolted against the humans, and we are nothing but slaves to them. \"The Terminator\" series comes to mind. But this time the treatment given to the story is different. \"The Matrix\" is an organic, mind blowing science fiction. There are lots of fluids, limbs, lack of hair, the design of the machines is also very organic, and the viewers can relate to that in a positive way. Also, the mistery provided by the first scenes - \"What is the Matrix?\" - tingles in our minds.This movie concentrates heavily on its characters. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, Cypher, Switch, Apoc, Tank, Dozer, Mouse and, last but not least, Agent Smith, all of them have their own personalities, singularities, and maneirisms, presented along the duration of the movie - two hours that go by very fast. And each character (except for Neo) is played by a relatively unknown actor, or an actor that were at a low point in their careers at the time. Today, it's impossible to not know who Carrie-Ann Moss, Lawrence Fishburn or Hugo Weaving are.But \"The Matrix\" is an excellent movie because of all its elements. Acting is good. Action scenes are fantastic. The soundscore is unforgettable. The soundtrack is quite appropriate (energic, full of fury - there could be no better choice than RATM). The script is ballanced - fast-paced scenes mixed in with slow, explanation dialogues and even one or two love scenes in the middle. And, finally, the direction.I don't know if the \"freezing time\" technology was invented by the Wachowski brothers, and I couldn't care less about it. What I do know is that they mastered it in \"The Matrix\". The first time I watched this movie I was extremely impressed with those \"frozen\" scenes. Action sequences can be now dated as \"before Matrix\" and \"after Matrix\". And the two directors provide a lesson about how to use slow-motion with good taste.Some people say that \"The Matrix\" is a re-telling of the New Testament. So what? \"The Lord of the rings\" is another one, too. What I want to say is that, no matter how you see it, \"The Matrix\" has a very interesting plot, and scenes that always leave the viewers with their jaws hanging. And it has become one of the greatest references in movie-making.Grade 9.3/10", "qas": [{"question": "What is the concepts of clorophila?", "id": "7f7e4ea0c480d6c9dacf1e94a31381d3", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I thought the special effects of this movie was outstanding.

It has great moments, a genuinely tragic true story, really lame dialogue, an unbelievable sentimental (though effective) \"romance\", and there are some factual errors in the film (which is not good considering James Cameron bragged about its authenticity).  Yet, this film is remarkable in so many ways.Titanic, by all accounts, should have been a box office disaster.  It has many things that the \"experts\" say will kill your film.  First, it's 194 minutes long.  Second, it has no stars (Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were not big stars when this was released).  Third, it's depressing (the boat sinks...SPOILER).  Fourth, it's predictable (the boat sinks...it's a true story).  Fifth, it was a troubled production that had its release date postponed due to cost overruns.  Yet, it is the biggest box office hit of all time.  The look of the film is sumptuous, with great production design, gorgeous cinematography, and excellent acting (for the most part).  Tecnhincally, the film is flawless (Cameron is known for his technological prowess).  As much as I like DiCaprio, I think he's a bit uncomfortable playing a role like this, but he is still believable.  Winslet is superb.  One of the best things about the film is how Cameron contrasts the upper deck snobs with the lower deck \"lower classes\", and how the lower classes are much more human and real than the snotty upper classes are.  Themes like that were not in great abundance in the 1990's.  There are moments of pure poetry and sadness, especially with the musicians playing on board as the boat goes down.However, the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio is hokey and detracts from the film a bit.  The film also makes a glaring omission that there was a nearby ship that ignored the flares and the calls from the Titanic.  I found this out in the film A Night to Remember, which was far more meticulous about the actual sinking and the reasons behind it.  This film was more about the romance between Winslet and DiCaprio.  There is an awful lot of really bad dialogue here, which also detracts.  Interestingly enough, the only main categories this film didn't get nominated in was screenplay (which Cameron, rather pigheadedly, complained about), and best actor (which DiCaprio didn't show up at the Oscars, which caused some controversy, unwarranted in my opinion).In conclusion, this is a pretty good film that should be seen.  James Cameron made a film that defied all expectations, and won a bunch of Oscars for it.  As of this writing, he is working on a new feature film called Avatar, but he didn't direct for almost 10 years after this film.  This film took a lot out of him, like Fitzcarraldo and Apocalypse Now did out of Herzog and Coppola (although those films are superior to Titanic).", "qas": [{"question": "How is the story?", "id": "54bf60b9098ee3ddd39aed42ca3d4e11", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Directed by James Cameron.

Yeah, I just love these one-dimensional characters where the poor are the noble underdogs, and the rich are evil bastards.Ahh, we all know about Titanic, probably the most overrated movie ever.

I've seen it more than any other movie, and it still continues to entertain (it's actually one of my favorites). But I won't pretend that it doesn't have any flaws, because it does. So anyway, you get the point. Cameron is a limited director, and shouldn't do anything besides action and sci-fi. Case in point, the dialogue for Titanic is bad too (there's too many embarrassing quotes to list). If anything, Titanic can give you some minor entertainment from it's laughable script.Instead of focusing on the real tragedy at hand, we get an unnecessary, clich&eacute; love story. Furthermore, I personally think the premise is ridiculously disrespectful. Taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story. WOW! What's next? 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or better yet, The Crucifixion (yeah, I bet Jesus had a few ladies on the side. That dirty dog!)? Why is this wrong? Because they're basicially saying, \"Ok, lets focus on these two characters, and ignore the rest! As long as these two get out, it doesn't matter who else dies!\". Sure enough, I've seen this movie with different groups of people, and none of them cried (or even cared for that matter) when most of the passengers were killed, but once Leonardo froze to death, then here come the waterworks! I don't care if I spoiled the movie for those that haven't seen it (since you shouldn't watch it anyway). Yep, a pathetic tearjerker ending to make the easily amused women in the crowd cry. No wonder it won so many Oscars.The acting here is pathetic. Leonardo DiCaprio was still in his teenage heartthrob phase, and didn't have an excellent director like Martin Scorsese to make him look good. As a result, his emotions seem terribly forced and unbelievable. Billy Zane is basicially the same, only twice as bad. It's quite embarrassing to watch, really (he should stick to cool movies like Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight.

Indiana Jones was created by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. It is an homage to the great cliff hangers of early cinema. Many scenes from these films come right out of Dick Tracey and other serials.Harrison Ford plays Dr. Jones an archeologist and adventurer who seeks to place precious relics in museum hands and out of the reach of scoundrels who use the antiquities for their own gains, and in the Nazis case their own agenda. To find out more about the film and why it is such a great adventure and a classic series I suggest viewing this set.I carry very fond memories of this series and I have enjoyed all the adventures of Indiana Jones. The box comes with 4 disc. The picture is sharp and the sound is in THX for those who have a certified system. The menus are nice here too and feature changing picture clips and music from the film.  One of the drawbacks of this set for me however was the absence of a director commentary on each disc and there are no German subtitles nor German language options. Those of you who have seen this series know that two of the three films featured the use of sparse German dialog and it would be nice to read what was said. The extra features have been saved to the fourth disc which includes a making of and other behind the scenes you would come to expect. I would however liked to have seen more from Lucas and Spielberg about their films and get some answers on what we can expect to see in the next film.

These 3 films are simply classics and will stay with everyone forever. For years and years, the Indiana Jones trilogy has been on VHS and in different trilogy packages, the most recent one coming with Young Indiana Jones tape in it. But, finally, the Indiana Jones trilogy has hit the DVD market, and we, the huge fans, are extremely happy it's in our hands, and in our DVD players.All 3 films have been digitally remastered with the wonderul THX. Picture is crisp and clear, color is great, and the sound is very good and redone. Only problem I found was the music score. The music score sounded kind of like it was underwater in some parts. Maybe it's just my speakers or somethin but I dunno. Not only does this pack come with the 3 classics, but it also comes with a Bonus Materials disc, which I'm just a little dissapointed in. I thought the movies would have commentaries on them, deleted scenes, gag reels, ya know, your run of the mill bonus material, but it doesn't It comes with a bunch of featurettes and trailers. Also, the price you can't beat. 45 bucks for 4 DVDs! That's a great price.Overall, this box set of the Indiana Jones trilogy is a must for all you Indy fans out there. Pick it up now, you won't regret it.", "qas": [{"question": "How is transfer?", "id": "5db3510e0892ca1622cfd934a1e56c0e", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "In my life I have met two people who have never seen an Indiana Jones movie; not surprisingly, they live together and are best friends. Despite that odd occurrence, I would bet money (not real, obviously) that you've seen at least one of the Indy movies, if not all four of them. The original trilogy remains a classic, and contains some of cinema's most memorable scenes.With the release of the new Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, things just wouldn't make sense if we didn't have tie-ins galore. LEGO Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford's face plastered on any buyable item you can imagine (from French fries to socks), and of course, a new, updated collection to allow people to catch up on everyone's favorite archeologist.The new Adventure Collection is the second Indy box set, the first coming out several years ago. For the most part, it's the same as always; the movies are identical, have no new scenes, and are (as far as I can tell) identical in video presentation. They feature the same slightly grainy and aged visuals that many movies from the 80s sport, although I will admit they seem to stand up a lot better to the test of time than other 80s era movies on DVD.What will get many Indy fans salivating are the new extras featured in the collection. Each disc includes a roughly 10 minute introduction by Spielberg and Lucas, talking about the filming process, and all sorts of interesting facts about what happened on the set.Each disc also includes its own unique set of extras, although they're rarely related specifically to that movie. For example, Raiders features a reminiscing look back at the series by the crew behind it, while Last Crusade features a piece titled The Women, which pays respect to the women of the Indiana Jones trilogy.Despite the new and (for the most part) very entertaining extras, I feel like an opportunity was missed out upon, as the set pulled a Princess Bride, neglecting to feature extras on the previous DVD release with the new ones. That means people who love Indy will be stuck holding onto their old DVD set as well, or picking which of the two has the better features. (A tough decision to make in all cases.)The Adventure Collection doesn't contain anything for casual Indy fans if they already own the last boxset. For newcomers to the series, I'd recommend it above the previous release. The packaging is more slim and streamlined, and the extras are just slightly better. Of course, diehard fans and trained archeologists like yours truly will end up having both in their collection, even if we know that we fell for the attempt to take more money out of our wallet for the Indy franchise. Such is the timeless power of Dr. Jones.CONTENT: 5/5Indiana Jones remains a classic. It's impossible not to give this boxset a perfect score, purely because it contains the first three movies. The extras make it go beyond perfect, but I can't exactly give a 6/5.VIDEO: 3/580s, 80s, 80s. It stands out amidst other recent releases, and there's little (if any) noticable upgrade to the video quality from the previous boxset. During action sequences, it's especially obvious.AUDIO: 4.5/5How did people the first time around love Indy as much without 5.1? The surround is fantastic, and hearing the Indy theme blare to life with a nice system supporting it is an awesome moment.REPLAY: 4/5How many times have you watched the Indiana Jones movies in your life? And how many people rewatched them all before Crystal Skull? They have tremendous staying power, even for multiple viewings.EXTRAS: 4/5The extras are good, and entertaining. They could have used some more length (most come in at 10 minutes or so), but even at the short time I'll take them. The only bad news is in a money grubbing scheme, you don't get past extras in the new collection. If you want those, you'll need to buy the old set, too.OVERALL: 4.5/5Indiana Jones is a classic. It inspired most of the people I know in archeology to go into archeology, and even at his age, Ford has managed to draw a whole new generation of little boys into the Indy Club. Still, it wasn't too long ago that we had an Indy boxset on DVD, and this features nothing new other than some new extras, which happen to be at the expense of the old ones. It's an obvious scheme to cash in on the new movie, but you know what? I don't care. It's a great collection for those who never had Indy on DVD, and if you did, you may want to consider picking this one up and gifting your old set to someone who doesn't have it yet.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the impact?", "id": "ac01d281f570734fd6c40dd050978c1f", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "0792833171", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Everything looks better on blu-ray, that includes Oz!

Verhoeven and screenwriters Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier surely had the ability to see into the future, as the world they envisioned has, in many ways, come true.Old Detroit, the near future.  The city is terrorized by a gang of thugs, headed by Clarence Boddicer (&quot;That 70's Show&quot; Kurtwood Smith) and his men.  The city has decided to turn over the operation of the police department to the OCP corporation.Enter cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), freshly transferred to the Old Detroit police department.  Partnered with Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), Murphy and Lewis hit the streets.An encounter with Boddicer and his boys leaves Murphy, well, dead.  Enter smarmy OCP executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), who has been developing a program to create a cyborg cop.  Murphy becomes his guinea pig and &quot;Robocop&quot; is born.Much of the social satire and humor Verhoeven interjects into the movies comes in the form of in-movie television broadcasts, the sort of which are common now, on CNN, MSNBC and the like.  Smiling reporters dish out daily doses of sex and violence to the masses.The story is essentially the robot Murphy's regaining of his humanity.  His creators erase his memory, or so they think, until Murphy begins to experience flashbacks from his former life, including memories of his death, which leads him on a search to avenge his death.  His search takes him back to OCP as he confronts the man who was responsible for his death.As submitted to the MPAA, &quot;Robocop&quot; was going to be awarded with the dreaded &quot;X&quot; rating for violence.  The Criterion Collection release of &quot;Robocop&quot; restores Verhoeven's original vision, which is a few seconds here and there of blood and gore.  While the film is indeed violent, the bloodshed is certainly tame by today's standards -- Verhoeven's &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; released in 1997, is much bloodier and violent than &quot;Robocop&quot; and it received an &quot;R&quot; rating.The transfer, while non-anamorphic, is still very good; the film is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen.  There are two audio tracks, a Dolby Digital 2.0 track and commentary track.  The commentary is lifted from the laserdisc edition of &quot;Robocop,&quot; and is an entertaining discussion with Verhoeven, his writers, and others involved in the production.Until &quot;Robocop&quot; gets the special edition DVD treatment, this Criterion version is worth hunting down.  &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar!&quot;", "qas": [{"question": "How old is the film?", "id": "40424bf2502e9c91604556a542d3fe7f", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "When I bought the DVD it was the first time I had watched the film for a couple of years.

Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain)kidnap them and drug them. The next day they sexually abuse, rape, humilate, torture and murder them for soon the parents find out and get sweet revenge.A vicious, cold-hearted and brutal look at the nature of crime from writer and director Wes Craven whom made a very nice debut with this grim shocker. This film caused a fuss back in 1972 as it was originally going to be rated X but got cut and earned an R rating for the film was very controversial yet made a fortune at the box-office. Audiences fainted during screenings and even made some people sick, David Hess steals the show as one of the sickest and vilest bad guys to hit horror cinema whom you wouldn't trust. The film was produced by Sean S. Cunningham (who would later do \"Friday The 13th\") and became one of the most influential horror movies of the genre that even Roger Ebert liked, sure the acting is bad and there's some un-needed comic relief. This movie is a kick in the groin that never lets go as it's a bloody yet nicely done and vile journey into the madness that is a powerhouse all the way that paved a big way for shock-horror.This DVD contains the unrated version which improves over the cut \"R\" rated version as it would make people feel unfortable.

Anyway, the original Star Wars Trilogy (sort of) is finally on DVD.  Yes, these are the Special Editions (sort of).  Even more changes have been made here.  I consider myself a moderate Star Wars fan: I enjoy the films and the video games, and I still collect some of the action figures, but I don't read all the books, sleep on Star Wars sheets, dress up like characters from the films, or anything like that.  There was a time when I was younger that I would've been very much against the idea of altering these films, but now that I'm older I feel that Lucas should be able to (for better or worse) modify his films (he would say \"complete\" them), but I also think the originals should be available for those who fell in love with them back in the day.Anyway, on to the films.  They look and sound great, and most of the changes don't alter the films in a negative way.  I like the addition of the Jabba scene in the original Star Wars, and they've improved the CGI to make him look more like he does in Episode I.  Unfortunately however, Greedo still shoots first in this version, and even though it's been improved a bit, it still looks bad, and still changes the story for the worse (in my opinion).  This is my single least favorite change in the whole trilogy.One other change that has some fans angry is the substitution of Hayden Christensen at the end of Return Of The Jedi: now, instead of seeing the spirit of an older Anakin, we see young Anakin...looking kind of creepy no less (though it would explain why old Anakin's body doesn't disappear when he dies if it was young Anakin who became one with the force).At any rate, this is a great set, and the bonus disc has (among other things) a great documentary on the making of the trilogy that will surprise a lot of long-time fans.I recommend this DVD set, though hopefully someday the original versions of these films will be released for those who want them.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the price of the dvd?", "id": "ce62495d43bb7a1042c1c7f7bdef489a", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Mark Hamill is going to kill me for posting this rationalization of the Star Wars film; so will Harrison Ford; Carrie Fisher I guess will just make \" Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" movies; as for George Lucas, I guess he's make edits of my childhood movie because (paraphrasing more or less) 'it was unethical to shoot Greedo first.'  So, here goes.This old world falls apart long before 'episode 4' by means of the growth of some dark force jedis. We have little to understand about the differences between the good and dark side of the force other than 'fear.' Well, I have a few things to say about 'fear'.Fear is the tactic used by the irrationalist.  The rationalist tries to establish observational/experimental facts and deduce new facts from there no matter how disheartening to our mental/emotional crutches(like the earth centered universe before the copernican revolution and the belief that god made us perfectly so evolution must be wrong).Let me elaborate about how the rationalist figures out the universe. We can't take in the whole universe all at one go; so, we idealize.  These are our definitions.  We make sure that our definitions only things that make sense with respect to each of the elements of a definition.  The elements of the definition are the same as a declarative sentence - noun, verb, noun.  What needs to be realized here is that a declarative sentence/definition is the language version of 'structure.'  Everything in the universe has structure; and everything in the universe is about changes of that structure.  There's things that have the same structure.  Two apples and two oranges can make(through idealization) two concrete examples of the same abstract structure - the number 2. The mathematical development(the symbol of rational thinking) really gets going when you relate these 'abstractions' to show how they transform into each other.  For instance by mapping the structures of 1 plus 1, you get the abstract structure of 2.  Basicaly, when you can show that the elements(nouns), or relations(verb) are in common, you can often transform various structures into one another(such as 1/2=.5; or, you could relate disperate fields and do things you could not before such as the abstractly identical structures of a tangent line and average speed formulas, and your on the road to calculus and the ability to calculate instantaeneous velocities and the areas of shapes with curved sides).See, the rationalist tries establish clear structural relations; the irrationalist tries to be evasive, fear monger, and be vague to avoid the 'question'.  For instance, what do most people tell their kids when they ask questions?  Either some b.s. answer, or!  God did it!  God is the algebraic X standing for \"I don't know.\"  What did 'God, or Elohim' say to Moses when Moses asked who's talking to him? He says shut up, \"I am that I am.\" And Paul in 1 Corinthians 9:22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.\" Getting back to God is the algebraic X standing for \"I don't know.\" . . . no matter what happens, good or bad, god did it; god believers will sweep the unethical problem of god making bad things happen(since he's the infinit all knowing and did everything god) by saying \"god works in mysterious ways.\"  They are also full of little mental(the dark side of the force) tricks like \"believe and you will believe.\"See, all the rationalist efforts came to a head around 1931 when Kurt Godel published his incompleteness theorems; basicaly, he said that a finite set of axioms cannot prove an infinity of truths; but, an inconsistent(the dark side of the force) can prove anything(god works in mysterious ways).See, god is used to make excuses for everything even dictatorships and claiming divine right to the thrown.  Those who did so(or do so) make all kinds of vague tricks to suggest they have divine right to the thrown.  Kings throughout the dark ages did exactly this.  Even the bible has god shutting up King Soloman from suggesting democracy and prefering dictatorship . . . at 1Samuel chapter 8:10-22.  George Lucas has come out and said, he thinks a holy one should rule the whole of planet earth.  See, the great human ability is to be able to combine ideas; the rational spirit does so mathematicaly; the irrationalist does so sometimes purely in terms of avoiding answering questions and growing, or a weird mixture of the two.  How rational is George Lucas?  Here's all the vagueness and fear gaming I found in the original star wars trilogy.In \"A New Hope\", C3PO and R2D2 are shut up by Han Solo when he tells them 'because Wookies are known to tear people's arms out of their sockets\" justifying Chewbacka getting away with a corruption of a game by pownting . . . Luke and OB 1 Kenobi are in a bar and some guy fear mongers Luke about how he has the death sentence on twelve systems; this is a good usage of anti-fear mongering; but, as you will see George Lucas(and most people in this world) clearly don't understand the true difference between the good and dark side of the force.That seems to be the only case in \"A New Hope\" which gives that movie a good overall rating; but then comes Empire Strikes back; here, Yoda shuts up Luke by saying \"this home it is\" even though Luke made an innocent remark about the surroundings.  Then, while inside Yoda's home, Yoda tells Luke, jedi are not interested in adventure; humans are about their ability to think and explore the universe.Return of the Jedi . . . Bib Fortuna the front door man of Jabba the hut is weak minded( he scoffs at the thought of Luke being a Jedi) . . . Luke goes to see Yoda and Yoda tries to demeen Luke by saying Luke looked at him wrong . . . when Han Sola, Luke and some others are captured by the ewoks, C3PO tells Luke and Han Solo he will not tell the ewoks to let them go because it would be improper to impersonate a deity.  Leia can't answer Han Solo about why she's talking to Luke(this is understandable considering she just heard some interesting news; she eventually comes out of it).  Darth Vader can't confess he's been bad when confronted by his son(this is actually a noble usage of personal problem mongering and its consequences).  Calrissian at first can't believe his copilot that the shields may still be up; he goes through the logic and eventually shows the character to confess that maybe his copilot has a point; this shows the central role of whether a person is being scientific or not; a person is either looking behind the veiled curtain of nature or he isn't; it takes character to do so.  Han Solo acts up and say's \"when he gets back, i wont' get in the way\"; Liea tells him he's her brother; well, at least  Han Solo kept cool enough to let her explain.Clearly, George Lucas is a mixture; he seems to understand there's this kind of weird fear gaming; other times, he seems to loose site, or he's a bit more conditioned than he can possibly imagine.  Yoda is clearly not the great thinking he portrays himself in his tone of speech.  I find this everywhere in the world.I thought I'd give some idea of how the prequils should have gone. Yoda was never at Coruscant.  Or, if ever visited the place, he long time ago went to his home world as a precaution from some dark side of the force long ago conquered at one time but never really understood. Young Jedis are sent to his world for training; but, they are kept in the dark as to where this world is; Yoda communicates through the force only.  This was stared hundreds of years before a growing dark side of the force springs up again.  The Jedi can sense it; but, they don't understand it; they are kind of naive just like George Lucas and most people today about fear and vagueness gaming. Like people today, they pride themselves in being socially sophisticated. People are going to drugs and irrationality religion all the time because even the Jedi can't answer all their questions(seen the recent commercials about; hey scientists, where's warp drive?  can't you answer me?  Can't you solve all my problems for me right now?). People are trying to move up the social power ladder all the time because they figure, \"who cares, nobody knows everything anyways; and, who cares, these people are willing to take to irrationalities anyways; there's a passage in Eusebius's \"Principia Evangelica\" to the affect of \"XXXI. That it will be necessary sometimes to use falsehood as a remedy for the benefit of those who require such a mode of treatment(that is Eusebius Preparatio Evangelica, book 12, chapter 31.\" I'd have the soon to be Emperor thinking along these lines.  But, of course, he can't make his move because he detects that the Jedi have a hidden Jedi.  So, he waits.  Then the Jedi find Anakin Skywalker; they send him to Yoda who finds to much of the dark side of the force in him; sends him back; Anakin gets into all kinds of further troubles which attracts the eye of the Emperor; trains him in the dark side force; Anakin accepts because the Jedi have been instructed to not teach him how to be a jedi, and, it goes from there.  There's more stuff.  There's suppose to be a clone war.  Perhaps the Emperor and Anakin find that there's too many Jedi; so, they clone themselves; they start a war keeping the Emperor and soon to be Darth Vaders new allegiance a secret.  Jedi are getting killed. Finaly, OB-1 and maybe a few are left; they finaly find out that Anakin has turned to the dark side of the force, they search him out; almost kill him; or, they think they killed him.  The emperor finds out, turns Anakin into Darth Vader; Darth vader goes and kills the rest of the Jedi except OB-1 because he knows Anakin's tricks.  The rebel alliance is quickly formed and goes into hiding.  This more or less sets the stage for the original star wars trilogy; of course, they never did understand how things went wrong in the first place even after they stopped the Emperor and Darth Vader . . . ;", "qas": [{"question": "What is the problem of the movie?", "id": "6a8068c6e6ece61605baf6fcbd6ac735", "answers": [{"text": "it", "answer_start": 294}]}]}, {"context": "I'm not a Blu-ray/HD aficionado, but I have the means to play Blu-ray discs and I have an HDTV, so I wanted an HD version of the Star Wars Trilogy.

I am truly looking forward to these films in their new versions but I sympathize with those who want their films untouched as they first viewed them. Perhaps in my mind, these may be some of the very FEW films ever made which could stand the updating and restoration... I say that for a few reasons. First of all, the Star Wars films in question depended so greatly on the prequels that have been made in the years since.... also they depend on their \"look\", and seen compared to episodes 1 and 2.. and probably the upcoming episode 3, they may not look so great to future Star Wars fans who will instead see them IN ORDER, which most of us DID NOT. To my thinking, if it these were not revamped, they would look weaker and more primitive to future generations caught up with the clarity and tone of the first 3 films.I TOTALLY agree that to change details of the story might not be wise, and I am not aware to what degree this will be done except for rumour... we all need to actually see them to make a judgement call for how each of us feels about the changes... but if it's simply a matter of cleaning up the special effects (like removing the gray boxes from the spacecraft against the black skies) and making Yoda look more like a living being and not a \"Muppet\" I am all for it.ARTISTS ALTERING THEIR WORKS:Is it okay for an artist to change his works? Some say NO. Yet in history, classical composers such as Bach, Bruckner, Debussy and many more, often had \"versions\" or new \"editions\" to change orchestration, orders of movements and even which instrument would take the lead in a concerto. Every art scholar knows that paintings are often painted and repainted by their original creators and sometimes overpainted by other painters many years later. The museums are filled with works that have had faces painted out, figures added, coats of arms changed or painted out and fig leaves added to male nudes. There are even paintings that are painted over other paintings that were already completed. This is more common in art history that you think. Many Italian and Dutch paintings have gone through extensive realtering. Sometimes even an artist would sign his name to another mans painting.... some works by Rembrandt were actually painted by others in his studio. He knew the painting would sell better with his name on it.These days, many a brand new Harley Davidson with state of the art design is bought by an owner only to be remodelled into a custom chopper to the raves of the magazines and buyers .... and that logic applies to cars, great buildings and other things.The REAL question is SHOULD motion picture films be altered? My general answer is probably \"NO\"... I believe in cleaning them, fixing badly done special effects, reprinting from the original negative, etc... if it does not ruin the integrity and look of the original (just as art museums routinely \"restore\" great paintings without a fuss from anyone).... but on the question of adding scenes and altering storylines... that is a trickier question. STAR WARS COULD be the exception for the above reasons and since it is their creator who is doing it. It is well known over the years, he has expended on his original 1977 ideas on these sagas and he wants to \"right\" that. This vision may conflict with OUR individual ideas of what these films may mean to us... but since when do individuals agree on what is \"right\" or lacking in any given film? I know many a Star Wars fan who hated the introduction of \"Jar Jar Binks\", or did not care for other aspects of one of the films upon release. So what is \"right\" for \"Star Wars\" remains the discretion of Mr. Lucas... the creator of these \"worlds\" we have been allowed to visit... and in 1977 he set to film a world he wanted to share with us and now, 30 years later, he wants to evolve that world for generations to be born long after we are gone while he still can.I think we need to see what the man will give us in this new set and then judge if it is for us or not. For what it's worth, I DO believe the original theatrical release should be available to those who want them... and the films are so popular, I think both the new versions and the original versions in release will be profitable for 20th Century Fox to have on the market.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the impact?", "id": "c9d444e5235e1c027f81e8b39b5f8db3", "answers": [{"text": "that have been made in the years", "answer_start": 511}]}]}, {"context": "These movies are classic, however the digital enhancing and added scenes don't add much, I only own the vhs to have a remastered copy of the 3 films...What is really amazing is that George Lucas didn't censor his classic films as opposed to his buddy Stephen Speilberg, instead he just added more enhanced graphics and took scenes he left out and added them in so we can see things we've never seen before, I think the only reason I went to go see these movies was because they were in the movie theatre and not on my tiny television, the updated graphics didn't stun me as much as the sound and picture of the big screen, overall, if you like the movies a lot and can't wait for the DVDs which are never gonna be released!!! :-( buy this vhs set.", "qas": [{"question": "How is movie?", "id": "1d9cd7f0273499015d2957d50d4fd839", "answers": [{"text": "These movies are classic", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "movies are classic", "answer_start": 6}]}]}, {"context": "Yes I can already tell you, some things are different in this, but coming from someone who hasn't seen these movies in almost 20 years (i almost bought the VHS set but decided against it) this looks just as good as i remember it and if you havn't seen it in a while, you won't notice the changes.

Lucas himself once said that special effects are there just to help you tell a story.  When he changed something that enhanced the experience, like most of his changes in Special Edition Empire-it was okay.  But when he starts having Gweedo shoot first, and changing little bits of dialogue, you have to start asking why.  There's no need for it.  The rhythem of the stories was there, and it worked.  Why does he keep messing with it?  In this boxset edition, on Empire Strikes Back, he changes Boba Fett's voice!  Again, I ask why?  Fett's voice was awesome.  He only spoke a couple of lines, but also became at least as popular as Vader.  His new voice sounds much less sinister and abrasive.  This just makes the Boba Fett we always knew to be obsolete.  And what is going on with putting Hayden into the end scene on Return of the Jedi?  Again, there's no need, not unless you also include Ewan Mcgregor along side him.  Why does he keep messing with these movies?  You had it right the first time Georgey boy!  If you want to change something, how about taking Jar Jar out of Phantom Menace?

In fact, Lucas says that he will not EVER release them.When the rumored \"Ultimate\" Star Wars Saga 6 DVD set is released, we may be able to see some deleted scenes from the original trilogy....the ones that Lucas removed 20 years later.We MAY have that to look forward to. But then again, this comes from a man who says that he cares about the people who made him a billionaire, yet robs them of the movies that they DO want, and repackages the movies that they already have, so that they will buy the darn things a year later.Thus the reason why the 4th disc has been removed....it makes the set sell for only $30 dollars rather than close to $50.I.E, Lucas and Fox want to hypnotize as many fans as possible, into buying this cheaper set, for the Holiday rush. Is it a coincidence that the DVD's are being released December 6th?Not September 6th. Not January 6th. No, these DVD's are being re-released right square between Thanksgiving and Christmas, when shoppers will be most busy.

Star Wars is a business to George Lucas. That is why he hasnt had a problem re-doing many of the original movie scenes. To him, its just a job.To him, these are just movies.The force is NOT strong in George Lucas.If it was, he wouldn't throw these EXACT movies as last year's DVD release in our faces and ask for over $30.If the force was truly with Lucas, he would have done what Spielberg did with E.T.-Released the original AND Special Editions of the movies, so that his vision and his fans memories could BOTH be fulfilled.Mr Lucas, you have much to learn, my old Padawan.The dark side is greed.

So, I do not plan to address those to ad nauseum, suffice to say I think the movies were perfect the way they were originally released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 respectively.I was one of the generation of young movie-goers who, after learning of this movie on the school playground, persuaded my mother shortly after my sixth birthday to drive 65 miles to see the movie at a small Scottish movie theater,I am assuming that people are familiar with the storylines of these three movies that chronicle the journey of farmboy Luke Skywalker from a remote desert planet to interplanetary hero and rising Jedi master.Regardless how you feel about the movies as they exist today, you cannot help but admit that this is an impressive set. After years of sitting on the fence over the format and drawing fire from the early adopters of DVD like myself, George Lucas has dived into putting out his movies on the digital format with a great deal of enthusiasm. The year before had seen the Indiana Jones trilogy finally finding its way onto DVD to much acclaim and here Lucas uses much the same formula (3 discs for the movies plus a bonus disc of special features) in his release of the original STAR WARS pictures.  Comprised in this set is (the retitled) A NEW HOPE (1977), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) and RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983).However, whereas the Indiana Jones set featured no film makers audio commentaries (Director Steven Spielberg apparently disapproves of the practice), here we have three very interesting audio commentaries. Appearing on all three tracks are George Lucas as producer (and director of A NEW HOPE), Sound Designer Ben Burtt, Special Effects wizard Dennis Muren and actress Carrie (Princess Leia) Fisher. Also joining the team for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the director of that movie Irvin Kirshner (the director of the third movie Richard Marquand sadly passed away years ago).Burtt provides some of the most interesting facts or the tracks, who knew that sound effects could be so fascinating?! It's really interesting to learn some of the most amazing things and places that Burtt used to come up with the sounds of the franchise. If you've ever wondered what was used to come up with the sounds of laser fire or the burps and beeps that R2-D2 uses then you will find the answer among these commentaries.But, in my opinion the best and most thoroughly entertaining commentary is provided for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Kershner is a very engaging and fascinating speaker and he relates a number of anecdotal information surrounding the goings-on around the set. He even mentions how he would get so taken by the Yoda puppet that he would catch himself giving direction to the puppet rather than Frank Oz and his team of puppeteers below the stage. Kirsh (as he affectionately known) also recounts the rigors the rigors of filming the Hoth scenes in Norway. He talks about the filming of the scene of Luke stumbling towards the camera (where he sees the image of Ben), with Kersh and crew warm and comfortable shooting from the entranceway of the hotel as actor Hamill was freezing outside.Sadly Fisher is the least talkative of all the participants which leads the commentaries to be top-heavy in technical details.As Indiana Jones had a three hour documentary on the making of those movies, so to does the STAR WARS trilogy. Named \"Empire of Dreams\" and shown in a heavily edited form on US television just prior to the DVD release, the documentary is incredibly detailed on all aspects of production.Knowing how popular and successful we now know STAR WARS was, its interesting to see how skeptical some at the studio (and on the crew) were regarding the viability of the movie. It is noted that the presence of the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.  What is gratifying is also the reaction to the rough cut of the movie to the Fox board, we learn that one of the executives cried at the screening and rushed home to tell his family about the amazing movie.Perhaps most interesting visually is the screen tests for some of those who tried out for the roles including Kurt Russell trying out for the Han Solo role. Funnily in a modern-day (circa 2004) on-camera interview Mark Hamill is still able to recount his lines from his 1976 screen test.Rounding out the set are a selection of smaller featurettes and trailers. Taken altogether this set is well worth the wait, There are various rumors circulating however that Lucas plans to redo the movies again, this time in 3-D but until the next editions this set will be a valued part of any DVD collection.", "qas": [{"question": "How would describe this version compared to the album version?", "id": "80f134c89fd2ac6751bfb30f69c5c2fe", "answers": []}, {"question": "Is the film very popular?", "id": "6b6b75242c9cb9a503fe1bacb9e2fd06", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This box set contains all three classic Star Wars films, noticeably restored even more than the VHS special editions, and a bonus disc with the most bonus stuff, I've ever seen on a DVD.

There are only 3 irritating changes, and 2 of them last only a few seconds. The Jabba scene is the only long change, and you can just skip that chapter with your remote.For the most part, the DVD transfer of these films went extremely well. The video looks crisp and clean. The CGI is beautiful. Honestly, I must agree that this is the way these films should be made. I AM upset that Lucas isn't releasing the OT, but if he did, I'd probably watch this version more often than the other. It's beautiful.That said, there are some serious quality issues here!!!1) When the Millenium Falcon is leaving the Death Star in Episode IV, the graphics on the TIE Fighters are messed up: There are grey bounding boxes around the fighters as they fly through space in some of the scenes. It goes by too fast for most of it, but when you notice it, it is very jarring.2) The audio for speaking parts is absolutely horrid in some places. Voices change from being muffled to tinny to muffled all within one scene. This happens the most on A New Hope. It is very irritating and jarring. For the most part, it damages the movie watching experience a great deal.3) Lightsabers. While most of the lightsaber scenes look better with the new graphics, several look horrible. The saber colors are muted, or they appear colorless, etc. Very sad considering that this was supposed to be a major selling point of this release.Overall, I am pleased, but I would not pay full price for this when the price goes up.

And quality wise, it looks fresher than when it hit the silver screens back in the 70's. The colors are fresh and bright, candy comes to mind when you see the pinks reds blues and violets, the flesh tones are scrumptous, it truly sets the standards for the DVD revolution.

You've done it again!!As for the third film, I am with the other commentor as to leaving Anakin as he was portrayed in the first rendition, It doesn't feel right, with the more mature Obe W. and Yoda.

Here's my take on the differences.It's easy to see what George Lucas thinks of us that want the original in Blu-ray quality: This version (with all it's digital 'enhancements' is beautiful. The colors look as if they were filmed on well-lit locations, not done with 1970's technology.The 'original' DVD, on the other hand wasn't even given full-screen status; it's shown in a box on my TV (on my DVD player, although my Blu-ray expands it automatically) as if I was watching it on YouTube. Even in a reduced size version, you can't miss the compression artifacts that cover the screen like a low-rez mpeg. It looks better upscaled on my blu-ray, but I still see the artifacts.The updated DVD is much better. At least it covers the full TV screen and lacks the digital artifacts. Both DVDs are a bit too bright in all conditions, probably to show detail that would be lost in the darker scenes.If you want the original story without the new distracting clutter, you won't want this Blu-ray (stick to the Limited Edition set, if you can find it). If you can deal with the changes (maybe consider it a good remake, instead), the color, detail, special effects, and sound make this a beauty to behold.As to the \"Han shot first\" complaints; I personally don't care who shot first, but I have a question for Mr. Lucas: If someone (a professional assassin at that) is holding a gun (bullet or laser) two feet from your head and pulls the trigger when he's confident he's safe, how likely is it that he'll miss?", "qas": [{"question": "How is video?", "id": "5c39269fef489076127e104578df5706", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Acclaimed filmmaker George Lucas catapulted the Sci-Fi genre to new heights with the breakthrough masterpiece, the \"Star Wars\" Trilogy.

The sheer experience of that film was exhilerating at a time when movie SFX were still a fair distance away from the quality we know and expect today. Few cinemas had stereo sound then because Dolby Stereo was in its infancy, and to actually be in a cinema so equipped at that time was a rarity. If you were really lucky, in addition to Dolby stereo, it might have a 70mm facility which would give you an enhanced picture, plus a 6 channel stereo split instead of the normal 4 channel of standard Dolby. Nowadays digital stereo in the cinema and home makes that sort of differentiating pretty irrelevent.Seeing Star Wars in stereo and with its incredible effects really was an experience . After that sound and SFX were never going to be the same, and neither have looked back since.Of the three films Return Of The Jedi is in 3rd place, a great film but is simply bettered by the two that came before it. In second place sits Star Wars itself. The film remains one of those viewing experiences which just remains in your mind as a milestone. What effects, what imagination, the ability to lift you out of every day life and take you to a galaxy, far, far away. Who can forget seeing that opening shot of the huge Star Destroyer bearing down on Princess Leia's fleeing vessel?No audiences had seen spaceships of those looks and dimensions on the big screen before...The pride of place by a whisker is taken by The Empire Strikes Back. Of the three films, this is the one that has stood up to more repeat viewings than the others. When I first saw it it did not have the effect that seeing the first did, absorbing though it still was. The passage of time has seen it establish itself as my fave of the trilogy though. I always felt that the plot for Star Wars drew on the Arthurian Legend and nowhere is this more apparent than in The Empire Strikes Back, particularly when the true identity of Darth Vader is revealed for the first time.There is a moodiness about Empire that runs through the film from start to finish, and I often wonder what Jedi would have been like if George Lucas had let the director of Empire Strikes Back - Irvin Kershner helm that film too....As to the controversy of the editing that Lucas has made to the dvd releases, my feelings are as follows:I loved the originals and have the vhs versions of all three. However, with nearly 20 years between Jedi and The Phantom Menace there were always going to be continuity issues concerning casting and SFX. Play an original vhs version of Star Wars, and you will soon see that the mattes have not aged well and stand out visibly. Yet did we notice them at the the time of the films release? No of course not because the SFX then were state of the art. Now with the passage of time and SFX having come on in leaps and bounds, George Lucas decided to update the former films.In my opinion he has done a good job too SFX wise. The casting editing is more to link with the newer editions of the franchise than to improve the quality of the originals, so my thoughts on that are mixed though. I can see the reason for doing it but I simply prefer the original actors in their roles. Clive Revill's Emperor in Empire Strikes Back I think is the deletion that was most unnecessary.Overall though I am glad that I have a choice and can either watch the originals on vhs or put on the updated versions on dvd.I have looked forward to the dvd release of these films for years and am delighted with finally being able to blast them across my home cinema set up. The picture on 16:9 anamorphic is great on a widescreen tv. All sound channels are crisp and totally clear of any distortion. Laser blasts and Tie Fighters shoot across the room to varying degrees...Such is the effect of being able to do that, it has returned me to the awe struck kid seeing Star Wars for the first time in a cinema.

BUT, Greedo did not shoot first. Jabba's appearance is a waste and is redundant script at best. Mos Eisley is crowded and cluttered with CGI junk. We all could go on and on. One thing; when Luke and company go tumbling in to the trash chamber, you can STILL see Luke mouth \"What was that?\" With all the \"corrections\" made, one might think they could have fixed that one.  Why George Lucus tampers with a masterpiece I do not know.  At this rate, if he ever aquires rights to the \"Wizard of Oz\", he probably will colorize the sepia tinted beginning and end.I am now 52 years-old and Star Wars is a pleasant memory and it is nice to see it in widescreen again. Remember, when it first came to the screen many of us baby boomers were expecting a cheapo SciFi flick and to the casual movie buff, no one even thought of a sextuple series. You didn't even know there might be a second one until the end of the movie when Vaders ship tumbles off in to space.To be honest, I think I'm one of millions that truely enjoyed Episode IV, A New hope and in my humble opinion none of the others have ever come close to duplicating the pure magic of A New Hope.

I bought it the week it came out, just like all the other Star Wars sets that have come before.  I have the original set from the early 80's, the letterbox version, the re-release version of the mid 90's, the special editions and now the DVDs.I have three versions of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones on DVD, let's not go into all the other Star Wars stuff I just can't seem to part with in 20+ years of collecting ect, ect....Suffice it to say, I am a huge Star Wars fan.  Oh yea, and I am a mid-30 year old gal.With all that in mind, here is my humble review.I loved the set.  It was crisp, clear, clean, the picture is absolutely gorgeous.  The soundtrack is so clear, you can't hear any distortions.  If this is what we have been waiting for all these years, fine with me!The Bonus material is really cool. There are a few documentaries, specials & TV commercials.  I loved watching the old trailers. I remembered them as soon as I saw them!  Very cool.  I wish they had added the older CBS docu-special that they did in '79 or '80 with C-3PO & R2-D2, my taped copy is in really bad shape.  That is fun to watch just to see them bickering.I haven't seen them all, but I have seen two so far.  Well worth the price of the set on their own.For the changes:1.  The Emperor/Vader scene in The Empire Strikes Back -  I think it flows a bit better.  And having Ian in the scene is much more believable.2.  Biggs scene in Star Wars:  A New Hope.  It's a bit out of place since you don't see the friendship with the two developed a bit more.  I believe the only way to see those scenes are on the Insiders CD-ROM of a few years back (and the novel).  So I was able to piece that together in my mind, but I suspect that the new fan or someone who was a casual viewer might go, who is that?3.  The biggest change of course is Hayden replacing Sebastian Shaw.  Okay, I'll admit it, this was the one and only time I cringed for a Star Wars update.  I thought why?  But, I have to eat my words.  It *worked*.  I liked the effect.  Now, I will say they should have gone a step further:  Where is Qui-Gon?  If they went as far as changing out Sebastian, where is Qui-Gon?  hmm?  you know, the guy who found our little bundle of midi-chlorians?  But back to Hayden, the effect was believable, it looked like he was there back in '83.  Do I miss Sebastian?  No.  Why? I have 4 prior sets of VHS tapes that are mine forever to watch when I want to see the big guy.  More Star Wars to watch and enjoy.Nit-picks:I want the added scenes.  Where is Luke on Tatooine fixing the vaporators, hanging with Biggs?  Yea, I listened to the commentary for Star Wars, I heard what George said.  Bonus disk, Bonus George...  I want the sandstorm scenes in RoTJ, I want R2's run in with a wampa...  At least they are on the CD-Roms, but still.  I am very greedy.Let's face it, these movies were written and released 20 + years ago.  Qui-Gon and crew were not yet around, so George is attempting to tie the whole series together.  I think he is doing a good job at it.  The changes flow, they don't leap! out at you saying, hey I'm a new scene, yoo hoo!The reason they seem that way to most older fans is simply because we are used to seeing the movie a certain way for over 20 years.People reading this may wonder why on earth I am happy there are all these changes.  I remember the 80's, after 1983 when Return was out. I remember all the years when Star Wars was done, gone and pretty much forgotten.  There were the West End game books, and that, folks, was it.  One thing I would get so upset about is you could find book ater book on Star Trek, nothing on Star Wars. It was pretty pathetic for the Star Wars fan.  Then the mid 90's came, Timothy Zahn and the new movies.  Star Wars has been back ever since.At the end of the day, would I like to have the older versions?  Sure. But, I am of the opinion the more Star Wars the better.  So, in my mind, George, thanks!  Bring it on, new & old, updates & special.  The more Star Wars from the Father of the Force, is fine by this Star Wars fangirl.", "qas": [{"question": "What is video?", "id": "a445491cfd0496c621d6389d8bf33fb5", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Episode IV - A New HopeSpecs and Features125 mins, PG, letterboxed widescreen (2.35:1), 16x9 enhanced, THX-certified, single-sided, RSDL dual-layered (layer switch at 63:08 at the start of chapter 28), keep case packaging with custom slipcase, audio commentary (with writer/director George Lucas, star Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt and special effects supervisor Dennis Muren), THX Optimizer, DVD-ROM weblink, 3 random animated film-themed menus sets with sound and music, scene access (50 chapters), languages: English (DD 5.1 EX & 2.0 Surround), French and Spanish (DD 2.0 Surround), subtitles: English, Closed CaptionedEpisode V - The Empire Strikes BackSpecs and Features127 mins, PG, letterboxed widescreen (2.35:1), 16x9 enhanced, THX-certified, single-sided, RSDL dual-layered (layer switch at 58:02 in chapter 27), keep case packaging with custom slipcase, audio commentary (with writer/producer George Lucas, director Irving Kershner, star Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt and special effects supervisor Dennis Muren), THX Optimizer, DVD-ROM weblink, 3 random animated film-themed menus sets with sound and music, scene access (50 chapters), languages: English (DD 5.1 EX & 2.0 Surround), French and Spanish (DD 2.0 Surround), subtitles: English, Closed CaptionedEpisode VI - Return of the JediSpecs and Features135 mins, PG, letterboxed widescreen (2.35:1), 16x9 enhanced, THX-certified, single-sided, RSDL dual-layered (layer switch at 62:38 at the start of chapter 22), keep case packaging with custom slipcase, audio commentary (with writer/producer George Lucas, star Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt and special effects supervisor Dennis Muren), THX Optimizer, DVD-ROM weblink, 3 random animated film-themed menus sets with sound and music, scene access (50 chapters), languages: English (DD 5.1 EX & 2.0 Surround), French and Spanish (DD 2.0 Surround), subtitles: English, Closed CaptionedStar Wars Trilogy - Bonus MaterialSpecs and FeaturesEmpire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy documentary (151 mins - 16x9, DD 2.0, 12 chapters), The Characters of Star Wars featurette (19 mins - 16x9, DD 2.0), The Birth of the Lightsaber featurette (16 mins - 16x9, DD 2.0), The Force is with Them: The Legacy of Star Wars featurette (13 mins - 16x9, DD 2.0), 10 theatrical trailers & 11 TV spots (all 16x9), production photo gallery, poster art gallery, Episode III preview featurette (The Return of Darth Vader - 9 mins - 16x9, DD 2.0), Episode III: Making the Game featurette (6 mins - 16x9, DD 2.0), videogame trailer, playable Star Wars Battlefront Xbox game demo, Easter egg, DVD-ROM weblink, keep case packaging with custom slipcase, animated film-themed menus with sound and music, feature access, languages: English (DD 2.0), subtitles: nonePart One - The Films & Changes\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\"It's very strange to finally be writing a review of these films on DVD. I don't think a single day has gone by in the eight years we've been running The Digital Bits that we weren't asked: \"When is Star Wars coming out on DVD?\" We've struggled to answer that question as best we could of course, constantly checking with both 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm. We've repeatedly tried to convince George Lucas himself to release these films on DVD, eventually succeeding in getting at least the prequel films on disc (after a LONG campaign with other websites in which we jointly collected over 30,000 signatures and took out a full page ad in Daily Variety). But as to the ultimate question of when Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi would be released on our favorite format, Lucasfilm's answer was always \"eventually\". Well... eventually has finally arrived, hard though it is to believe.The Star Wars Trilogy arrives on DVD in the form of a new 4-disc box set, containing not only the much-loved movies, but also a separate disc of all-new bonus material. So let's take a closer look, shall we? We'll start with the films themselves.As most of you know, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a young farmboy living on a backwater planet with dreams escaping his humdrum plight for a life of heroism in outer space. It seems that the galaxy is embroiled in a massive civil war between the evil Galactic Empire and the freedom-loving Rebel Alliance. Luke longs to fight for what he believes in, but the conflict is raging a long way from his far-flung world... at least until a pair of bumbling droids suddenly arrives on his uncle's farm. Luke discovers that the droids are carrying a secret message from a Rebel princess, intended for a wizened Jedi Knight named Obi-Wan Kenobi, who happens to live nearby. The droids are also carrying the stolen plans for the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, a massive space station with enough firepower to destroy an entire planet. Unless these plans can be safely delivered to the Rebel forces, their struggle for freedom and justice will be crushed once and for all. So with the help of Kenobi and a wise-cracking pirate named Han Solo, Luke suddenly finds himself whisked away into deep space on the adventure of his life, pursued all the while by the Empire's most sinister agent of evil... Darth Vader.It's really unnecessary to say much more about this film, as you're all no doubt intimately familiar with it by now. Released as a lark in 1977 by 20th Century Fox, George Lucas' original Star Wars became a hugely successful blockbuster almost overnight and it quickly changed the landscape of Hollywood filmmaking, not only reviving a long-lost cinematic genre but also pioneering the field of movie visual effects. The film had an incalculable impact on my then ten-year-old life, opening my eyes to the possibilities of the film medium and firing my imagination like nothing before it. I'm certain that, like me, most of you have a very special place for the film in your hearts. But Star Wars today is somewhat different than you might remember it from 1977... or even the 1997 special edition re-release.As you may have heard, a number of new digital changes have been made to the Star Wars films for this DVD release. As with the 1997 special edition, A New Hope has received the majority of the attention. Many shots have been altered in very subtle ways, which only the most zealous fans will notice. There are, however, a number of more major changes. In A New Hope, these include a revised opening shot as Luke's landspeeder enters Mos Eisley Spaceport (the speeder model is more detailed and moves more naturally), an improved version of the Han/Greedo fight (Greedo still shoots first, but only just - the blasts are much closer together and Han's movement is smoother), a new CG model of Jabba the Hutt (it's a revised version of the Episode I model of the character and is much improved) and re-rotoscoped lightsaber blades throughout the film (blade color is more pronounced and the animation is more like the prequel films). Personally, I quite like most of these changes. The Han/Greedo fight is still less than perfect, but it does look more natural. Han's head doesn't jerk like it did before - instead his whole upper body shifts over slightly. And the blaster shots are VERY close together now, so the encounter is not as implausible as it was in 1997. I still wish George would just let Han shoot first as he did originally in 1977, but I can at least stomach watching this scene now.Three years after the release of the original film, Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back continued the epic adventure. After successfully destroying the Death Star, Luke and his Rebel friends have been pursued across the galaxy by Darth Vader and the Empire's mighty space fleet. While hiding out in a new secret base on the frozen planet of Hoth, the Rebels are discovered by Vader. After a massive snow battle, our heroes barely escape with their lives and are scattered across space. Luke finds his way to the jungle planet Dagobah, where he begins training to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, Han and the princess find refuge on the planet Bespin, unaware that they've been followed by Vader's forces. Soon, Luke must abandon his training to come to his friends' rescue, ultimately risking his fate in a reckless confrontation with Vader himself.Widely considered to be the best of the Star Wars series, The Empire Strikes Back tells a much darker and more personal story than the original film, despite the inclusion of several dramatic action sequences. In a risky move, this unconventional sequel sees the good guys basically getting their asses kicked from the start of the film until the very end. It's not a happy or upbeat adventure by any means, and it ends with a stunning and unforeseen twist that left theater audiences hanging on the edge of their seats for more than three years after its original release in 1980. Despite the cliff-hanger ending (or perhaps because of it) Empire ranks easily among the best film sequels of all time. It holds up well to this day.The digital changes to Empire for this DVD release are fewer than they are in A New Hope. In fact, there are only three major changes. These include the use of Temuera Morrison as the voice of Boba Fett (which I suppose makes sense given that Boba is a clone of Jango from Episode II), the elimination of Luke's scream when he jumps to escape Vader on Cloud City (which had been a source of much debate among fans - why would he scream if he were jumping willingly?), and the use of actor Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor (replacing the old woman and voice actor Clive Revill who played the character originally). I should note that the Emperor alteration also involves a change in the scene's dialogue - one that is at first confusing. The Emperor now tells Vader that he has no doubt \"the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star\" is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker, to which Vader replies \"How is that possible?\" That doesn't seem to make sense, because we know that Vader is aware of who Luke is from dialogue earlier in the film (\"That's it. The Rebels are there. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.\"). I suspect, however, that we'll find out in Episode III that Anakin DOES learn of Luke's existence as an infant, and he hides this knowledge from the Emperor. What that would mean is that Vader's been waiting all these years to find Luke as an adult and turn him to the Dark Side so that they can overthrow the Emperor together - a plot Vader ultimately confesses to Luke at the end of Empire. We'll have to wait for Episode III to see how this new bit of dialogue fits in.Concluding the original trilogy in 1983, Episode VI - Return of the Jedi opens as Luke, now a fully trained Jedi Knight, returns with his friends to his home planet to rescue Han Solo from the vile crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke then revisits Dagobah and learns that he must ultimately confront Darth Vader if the galaxy is to have any hope of peace. Luke also learns a surprising secret before rejoining the Rebels as they prepare for the final, decisive battle in the conflict between Rebellion and Empire - an all-out assault on the Emperor's second and even more powerful Death Star.As the final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi fails to be either as fresh as the original film or as surprising as Empire. Too much is predictable here (such as the appearance of a second Death Star) and too many compromises were made for the younger audience members (the very presence of the Ewoks, for example) which is especially noticeable after the more adult themes of the previous installment. That said, Jedi does manage to adequately complete the story arc of the original trilogy. There's nice symmetry with the way the character storylines are wrapped up, and there's enough action to keep the film interesting. I'll be curious to see how well this conclusion works in the context of the overall 6-film saga once Episode III arrives in theaters in May, 2005.As with Empire, are three major digital changes to Jedi, all of which appear at the end of the film. When Luke removes Vader's mask to reveal his father's face, the eyebrows of actor Sebastian Shaw have been erased (presumably because Anakin's face will be badly burned in Episode III). Then, after the second Death Star is destroyed, when the film cuts to the various celebrations around the galaxy, Naboo is now included among the planets we see. Finally (and this is a big one), when the Force ghosts of Ben, Yoda and Anakin appear to Luke at the very end of the film, actor Sebastian Shaw has been replaced with Hayden Christensen (as he'll appear in Episode III). That's going to piss off a lot of fans, but it makes sense. I suspect the rational is that a Jedi's Force ghost is frozen in appearance at the exact moment of his or her death. Since Anakin Skywalker basically ceases to exist in Episode III (becoming Darth Vader), his ghost remained at that age. Yeah, it's a stretch, but hey... within the logic of the universe, it does make sense. Like it or not.Ultimately, I've accepted that Lucas is entitled to change these films until he's happy with them. The fact is, he's been changing them since 1977 (for example, right after the first film was released and became a hit, Lucas quickly went back in and added the Episode IV - A New Hope tag). These new CG alterations are simply the logical continuation of his desire to overcome the technical challenges he faced when he originally made the films. I have to tell you, I'm as surprised as anyone to find myself actually appreciating most of these changes. With the sole exception of the Han/Greedo scene (which still bothers me, although less now than as it was in 1997), I think all of the changes are either genuine improvements or simply make sense given the ties to the prequel films. I still think Lucas has a responsibility to save the original versions of these films out of respect for the fans who have supported them all these years, the artists who creatively invested themselves in the original work, and as a way to remind us all just how far the films have come since they were first released. And I still have hope that we'll see those original versions released on disc... eventually... in a more elaborate box set of the entire saga. But more on that later.So that's the films as you'll find them on these new DVDs. Now let's talk about the DVDs themselves. Click to the next page of the review and I'll tell you all about it.Part Two - DVD Presentation Quality & ExtrasThe most important part of any DVD presentation is the video and audio quality of the film itself. So how do the Star Wars Trilogy DVDs stack up in this regard?Simply put, the Star Wars films have never (and I mean EVER) looked this good before. The films presented on these discs absolutely sparkle, in all their anamorphic widescreen glory. The folks at THX and Lowry Digital worked for months to create new high-definition digital masters of these films, transferred directly from the original negatives. Once the films were transferred, painstaking efforts were made to clean the digital masters of dust, dirt, scratches and excessive grain. To give you an idea of just how much work was involved, more than 100 bits of debris were digitally removed from EACH FRAME - ultimately entailing the removal of over 10 million such blemishes in all over the three films combined. As a result, you will not find a single speck ANYWHERE on any of these films. The snow-white slopes of Hoth and the sand-baked dunes of Tatooine have never looked so pure.Because the transfers were done from the original negatives, you're going to see detail in these films that you've never seen before. You'll notice this right from the opening shot of A New Hope, when the Star Destroyer chases its quarry over the surface of Tatooine. Just look at the subtle swirl of could patterns on the planet below - astonishing. Best of all, not a lick of added edge enhancement was required to bring out this detail. What else is good? The color palette here is more lush and accurate than ever before. You're going to be blown away by everything from subtle flesh tones to the vibrant gold plating on C-3PO's chest to the bright orange flightsuits of the Rebel pilots. Contrast is also spectacular, with deep detailed blacks and clear, accurate whites. All three films in this set are just going to absolutely blow you away, and the bigger your screen the better it gets. The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is the best excuse you're ever going to have to go out and buy yourself a good anamorphic widescreen display. Until true high-definition arrives, it just doesn't get better than this.On the audio side, all three films have been fully re-mixed in true Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX. The dynamic range in these mixes is impressive - everything from the softest passages of John Williams' signature score to the most explosive moments of action will full your home theater space with natural, immersive sound. The mixes are packed with atmospheric fill, active panning and surround play. The matrix-ed EX center back channel is nicely active - you'll definitely be glad you have an extra speaker back there, believe me. Dialogue is at all times clear and the LFE will really give your subwoofer a workout. These audio mixes are an absolutely appropriate match to the near perfect image quality. The sonic experience of these films on DVD will floor you.As with the previous DVDs for The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, each movie disc features there different menu sets themed to the various planets visited in the film. These appear at random when you boot up the disc (although there are codes you can use to see specific sets - see the Easter egg guide on the previous page).In terms of extras, each movie disc also features a full length audio commentary track with members of the cast and crew. For all three films, George Lucas provides his thoughts on the overall themes and concepts, as well as interesting anecdotes on the characters and production. Actress Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) chimes in as well with her thoughts and shares some particularly funny behind-the-scenes stories about working on the films. Sound designer Ben Burtt discusses his audio work and the creation of various sounds for each character, vehicle, prop and environment. And Dennis Muren addresses the elaborate special effects work. For the Empire commentary, director Irving Kershner joins this group to provide his insights on the making of the film. As with the The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones commentaries, the name of the person talking will occasionally appear at the top of the screen to help you identify them. I don't want to spoil anything here - you've all been waiting so long for these DVDs that it's just better for you to experience it all yourself. Just know that the commentaries are fascinating and absolutely worth listening to.The majority of the extras in this set are contained on its fourth disc, appropriately titled Bonus Material. This opens with an animated menu that depicts the Falcon flying through the asteroid field in Empire (you eventually end up in the Falcon's cockpit to make your selections). I should also note here that nearly every item on this disc is presented in anamorphic widescreen video - a very nice touch.Arguably the most important bonus feature on the disc is Kevin Burns' 151-minute Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy documentary. Burns was given full access to the expansive Lucasfilm Archives and was able to uncover hours of behind-the-scenes footage from the making of these films that you've definitely never seen before. The documentary begins with Lucas' original idea for the films, then covers the development, pre-production, filming and post-production of the original Star Wars in tremendous depth. Burns' idea was to take you back to 1977, to relive not only the struggle that was the making of the original film but also the film-going climate into which it was ultimately released. You are there are at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, waiting in line to see the film for the first time. You actually get to see the original version of the opening crawl, sans the Episode IV - A New Hope tag (and it will give you chills to see, believe me). You get to hear from absolutely everyone involved in the making of these films. Over 40 new, in-depth and original interviews were conducted with all the major cast members, the production staffers, etc. They're all here to give you their thoughts on the films.The first hour of Empire of Dreams is devoted exclusively to A New Hope, and then the remaining time is split between the making of Empire and Jedi. As I said, you're going to see things you never knew existed - footage of the cast clowning around on the set, a couple alternate versions of scenes from the films, plenty of production artwork and still photos - you name it. Irving Kershner tells a great story about how the secret of Luke's parentage was kept hidden from the cast, crew and fans. It's pretty amazing stuff. The documentary does drag a little bit once you get past the first hour, but you'll still enjoy every minute of it and you'll probably watch it more than once if you're a fan.Also on this disc are a set of three production featurettes. The Characters of Star Wars tells of the development of each character within the story and how each major role was cast. This includes some great, never-before-seen video of actors who tried out for the parts but didn't get them. Can you imagine Kurt Russell as Han Solo? Cindy Williams as Leia? William Katt (yeah... The Greatest American Hero) as Luke? It's fun stuff.The Birth of the Lightsaber addresses how the traditional weapon of the Jedi came to be. We get to see rare video of fight rehearsals and on-set raw footage (without the blades rotoscoped in). Ben Burtt tells you how he came up with the sound, etc. Again, good stuff.The Force is with Them: The Legacy of Star Wars looks at the influence the Star Wars films have had on Hollywood filmmaking (and filmmakers) as a whole. It features new interviews with the likes of Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and many others as they each talk about how the success of these films affected their careers and their work.Fans of Star Wars minutiae will be pleased to learn that a whole gallery of rare theatrical trailers and TV spots for each film has been included on this disc, each in anamorphic widescreen video and presented in quality you've never seen before. There are also galleries of original poster art for the films, as well as a gallery of rare production photos. The production photos are very cool to see, but they're also a little frustrating because they include images from many deleted scenes we've all been waiting to see for years. That's all fine and good... except none of these actual scenes are included on the disc. That's right - you will not get to see Luke and Biggs on Tatooine from A New Hope, the Wampa attack from Empire, or the sandstorm from Jedi. The fact that they're not here is deliberate and tells you something else - they've been held back for inclusion on a more elaborate special edition release of these films in the future (I actually have word from sources that Lucasfilm is already planning the high-definition box set of the whole 6-film saga, possibly for the original film's 30th anniversary in 2007). It shouldn't come as any surprise that more elaborate special editions will eventually be released, but I found the lack of deleted scenes here to be irritating and I think others will as well. It's a major strike against the extras on this set.There are three other cool extras on this disc you'll want to check out (and others many of you won't give a rip about). The cool stuff includes a long-awaited sneak peek at the forthcoming Episode III. This takes the form of a featurette on the return of Darth Vader. We get to see the production staff building the new Vader costume, actor Hayden Christensen talking about what it's like to don the familiar black helmet, and Christensen and co-star Ewan McGregor practicing the infamous lightsaber duel that will climax the film. I think it will get you sufficiently pumped for the last Star Wars film ever... at least enough to hold you over until November when the teaser trailer for the film will arrive in theaters.Speaking of trailers, as with the previous Star Wars DVDs, these discs include DVD-ROM weblinks to an exclusive online site where you may get the first look at additional footage from these films, the Episode III trailer, etc.The other cool extra is a nifty Easter egg hidden in the bonus disc's menus. Like the previous DVDs, \"1138\" is the code to unlock it. When you do this successfully, you'll be treated to a funny gag reel from the original Star Wars films (see the Easter egg guide on the previous page for instructions on how to access it). I should also note that two of the aforementioned production featurettes on this DVD have funny little moments during the credits that you'll enjoy as well.What's left on this disc is the not so cool, by which I mean the marketing fluff. This includes a trailer for the Star Wars Battlefront Xbox game and a preview teasing the making of the forthcoming Episode III videogame. I frankly don't care about either, but I suppose some of you out there will. It's also worth nothing here that if you put this disc on your Xbox machine, you'll get to play a complete preview level of Star Wars Battlefront. Again, I couldn't give a rip, but I'm sure some of you will appreciate this.So that's the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, circa 2004. The films themselves definitely look and sound better than you've ever seen them before, and there are enough little (and not so little) tweaks and changes to each one to either thrill you or make you want to pull your hair out (or both). The extras on this 4-disc set are generally quite good, with the exception of the marketing material and the lack of deleted scenes. None of it is truly great, but it's certainly good and worthy of your time. Going through these extras, you definitely get the sense that what's been included here is just the tip of the iceberg, and that much more elaborate special editions of these films are likely to find their way to disc in the years ahead. Given the long wait to get these films on DVD... well, no DVD release could probably be equal to that level of anticipation. Still, with picture and sound quality like this, it's pretty easy to justify the purchase price for this set. Throw in the documentary and the audio commentaries, and it's really a no-brainer.After all my bitching and moaning about getting these films on DVD over the years... my occasional tantrums and frequent soap box proclamations... am I finally a happy Star Wars fan? You know, I don't even know what the words \"happy Star Wars fan\" mean anymore. But am I secretly giddy that I finally have these films on DVD? Yeah, I am. I hate myself a little for it, but such is the curse of Star Wars geeks everywhere. No matter how angry and jaded I get, I still get chills when that logo crashes across my screen and that familiar John Williams fanfare blares over my speakers. Yeah, I got a bit of the goosebumps when I found out that Episode III was going to be called Revenge of the Sith. And yeah, I'll go to whatever crap movie the Episode III teaser trailer is attached to just for a couple minutes of eXtreme geek-out time. Don't even try to pretend that a lot of you don't feel the exact same way. We're a pretty pathetic bunch aren't we?Anyway, I hope you all enjoy these DVDs. God knows you've waited long enough to get them.", "qas": [{"question": "When do people appear in the passion of Christ?", "id": "d93d50a4575c566715daba1e0c7e63ff", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The quality of this DVD set is, so far, outstanding.

That movie was followed by the cliffhanger sequel \"The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980), and the third film in the series was \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). After tinkering with the three movies a little, Lucas released new theatrical versions in 1997. Now, tweaked versions of the 1997 films have been released as a four-disc DVD set under the collective title \"Star Wars Trilogy,\" marking the first time any version of these three films has been available on DVD.The 1977 movie commonly known originally as simply \"Star Wars\" has been retitled \"Star Wars IV: A New Hope,\" and \"Star Wars V\" and \"Star Wars VI\" have been incorporated into the titles of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi,\" respectively. The retitling came about in connection with a trio of prequel films that began being released theatrically in 1999, and the numbering scheme indicates where each movie fits into the epic story's chronology.I've always found all three films in the Star Wars Trilogy to be great, and they form a unified whole. I wouldn't characterize them as science fiction I would describe them as pulpy space fantasy action adventure movies. They are set in some distant galaxy during a civil war, and we side with freedom-fighter rebels who are battling the evil Galactic Empire. I would say the \"Trilogy\" is an elaborate coming-of-age tale where we follow the maturation of an idealistic farm boy named Luke Skywalker.On his adventures, Luke teams up with daredevil smuggler Han Solo and plucky young Princess Leia, But Lucas has packed the \"Trilogy\" with a host of quirky characters, including a pair of delightful androids called C-3PO and R2-D2. And I think the movies' chief villain, Darth Vader is one of the most memorable in all of cinema.I've always found it intriguing that some inhabitants of the galaxy embrace the belief that there exists a mystical energy called the Force. There are certain beings called Jedi who seemingly derive special powers from the Force and use them to bring about good. To me, Alec Guinness gives an unforgettable performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a wise old Jedi who mentors Luke. Young Skywalker also receives training from another Jedi, the diminutive Yoda. But the Force is not automatically a source of good: it has a corrupting Dark Side that can result in evil.Each movie in the Trilogy is contained on its own single sided disc, and as far as I am concerned, the three feature films all look and sound terrific: the colors are vivid, the picture is sharp, and the sound is clean. The DVDs provide feature-length audio commentary tracks for all three movies. George Lucas, actress Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt, and visual effects expert Dennis Muren are heard on all three tracks, and these four commentators are joined by a fifth, director Irvin Kershner, on \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" I found all three commentary tracks worthwhile, and I particularly enjoyed listening to Lucas and Kershner. Burtt gives more details about the sound than I really want to know.", "qas": [{"question": "How about audio?", "id": "568b9ea1ab78784cdbbba0f6afb13ecb", "answers": []}, {"question": "How can I paint my house a nice color?", "id": "79a521ddd70c217aad51df7ddc89c247", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "When Star Wars opened in 1977, theaters were packed, with audiences waiting in lines to see the \"space opera\" that George Lucas had masterfully crafted.  The movie, which became one of the top-grossing films of all time, changed forever the way science fiction movies were made, elevating the genre from the realm of B movies to serious fiction, so much so that the original Star Wars movie, subtitled \"A New Hope\", was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar that year.The technology of the time was somewhat limited, and though it was considered \"cutting edge\" in its day, special effects limited the vision which George Lucas had hoped to present to his worldwide audience.  It seemed only fitting therefore that on the anniversary of his Opus, he would return to the world of Star Wars once more, re-inventing the movie that launched a franchising monstrosity in a galazy not so far from home.What was created was the extended edition of the Star Wars movies, with a special focus on the first installment, \"A New Hope\".Industrial Light and Magic, Lucasfilm's effects house, which was in its infancy at the time Star Wars was produced, was brought back on the project once more to expand the film into the vision Lucas had originally envisioned.  While all three films were to be \"touched up\" for the 20 year anniversary release, it was \"A New Hope\" that was given the biggest facelift.  Scenes that had been cut were re-introduced to the film, new scenes, with the aid of some cutting edge CGI were created, and the film as a whole was retouched, enhancing the color and sound through the use of digital processing.The movie opened with much of the same hype as it had 20 years earlier.  Storylines, which had been developed in \"the Empire Strikes Back\" and \"The Return of the Jedi\" were fleshed out some in this first film, and for the first time, we saw the famous scene where Han has his initial run-in with Jabba the Hutt (a scene that was omitted in the original release due to a lack of effects technology to create the slug-like Jabba).  Additional sequences included a greatly enhanced Mos-Eisley spaceport, full of droids, strange alien lifeforms and a barrage of businesses and settlements that gave the city a much greater scope than the original.Similar additions were created for the sequels, though most of the revision work there surrounding the enhancement of exisitng scenes.  As with \"New Hope\", the films were cleaned up, providing new digital effects where blue screen and miniatures had been used previously.  The changes, more subtle than the first, are still impressive, especially the altered ending to \"The Return of the Jedi.\"  Though this reviewer will not ruin the ending for the viewer, lets simply state that there will no longer be a need to suffer through the Ewoks song that seemed sadly anti-climatic at the end of the original release of the film.The special effects in these films play more like characters than situations, and ILM has done a great job of cleaning them up.  Especially impressive are the new fight/flight sequences at the end of \"A New Hope\" when the Rebel Alliance is engaged with the Empire with the intent of destroying the Death Star.  The new visuals, which were blended in many cases with existing effects, are much more fluid, providing a greater sense of reality to the viewer.For anyone unfamiliar with the story surrounding the Star Wars franchise, it begins with a farmboy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), whose greatest dream is to be a pilot in the Imperial Fleet.  When his uncle purchases a pair of droids for their farm, he uncovers a secret message recorded by the beautiful Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) for the mysterious Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan (Ben) Kenobi (Alec Guiness), which begins a string of events that will forever change Luke's life.  With the aid of rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca, Ben and Luke, along with C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2, head out to Alderan where they hope to aid the rebel alliance in overthrowing the Empire by destroying the Emperor's most lethal weapon, the dreaded Death Star; a spacestation capable of destroying entire planets.  Upon their arrival,they run head-long into the Death Star, which has recently destroyed the planet of Alderan, Leia's homeworld.  Their ship captured, the crew escape capture with the aid of Han's smuggling compartments built into the floor of his ship.  They set out into the Death Star to rescue the princess, dis-engage the tractor beam and ultimately return to the secret base of the Rebel Alliance.  Kenobi, whose actions differ some, sets out to confront Darth Vader (David Prowse (voiced by James Earl Jones)), ambassador to the Emporer and former pupil of Kenobi.The balance of the story, and the sequels, are for the viewer to discover.  These films, which have been digitally transfered to video cassette in both wide screen and full screen editions, are spectacular, with a clarity of sound and color that is better than any other release of the films to date.  The extras on the video cassette are sparse, save for a three-part \"Making Of\" serving as an introduction to each of the films.  Narrated most by Leonard Maltin (film critic) and George Lucas, these introductions to offer a good glimpse into the process Lucas and his sizable staff undertook in the re-creation of the many sequences in each film.As the original Star Wars Trilogy is not yet available on DVD, this collection is probably the closest transfer in existance of these films to a digital video.  The videos are clean, with enhanced sound and color that really do make the movies seem as if they were brand new, instead of a re-release of a film that is over 20 years old.  The additions to each of the film are enjoyable, though some look contrived, especially the sequences surrounding Vader's return to his Star Destroyer at the end of \"The Empire Strikes Back\". (You will note that the general who meets him at the end of Empire is the same as the one who greets him at the beginning of \"Jedi\".  It would seem that Lucas spliced some spare footage from \"Jedi\" into \"Empire\" to expand the scene.)Though many critics complain that the films should not have been doctored, the extended edition nonetheless does offer up a fresh look for the films and, for the uninitiated, the closest opportunity available to experiencing the Star Wars franchise the way it was seen when it first packed the theaters in 1977.  These films have stood the test of time, and now, with the release of all three in this collector's edition, are a worthwhile addition to any video library.-Scott Kolecki", "qas": [{"question": "How many stars does this movie deserve?", "id": "4ffefa2f95591e75623e50e46090dcd5", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "It is so darn obvious that George Lucas made the new special editions for kids. The reason (I believe) Han shoots first is to show kids that it was in self defence, and that it's wrong for a good guy to shoot first and kill them if not in self defence.The Jabba scene in ANH is WAY out of place. For one the ROTJ Jabba is far bigger, and remember when Luke said the Falcon was a piece of junk? Well now that we have viewed the Falcon before this scene, it won't have the same impact.

Most of all it's so much fun to watch, because no matter what age you are it brings the kid inside of you alive.Alive is what you will feel when viewing these Blu Rays.  These Blu Rays are by far the most impressive I have ever seen of an older movie restored, many times unbelievable was the word that came to mind.  Picture quality on all three films is crisp and clear, the best they have ever looked and then some.  The light sabres glow with intensity, Darth Vaders helmet shines with mirror like blackness and certain scene details come to life for the first time.  Several times I found myself looking at the characters detailed surroundings instead of the character themselves.  The picture quality on all three films has been so thoroughly examined there are not any moments where you wish they could have done more in any particular scene.  The picture quality is simply amazing and your eyes will be glued to the screen with the dynamic DTS HD Master Audio mix that draws you in with its dynamic use of the sound field.The picture quality is amazing, but the DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is in one word AWESOME. If ever you wanted to be immersed into the Star Wars universe this soundtrack will leave you awestruck. Star Destroyers rumble the scene as they pass over, Tie fighters scream from the rears to the fronts as they fly over and fight scenes come alive like an actual war is taking place in your media room.  AT-ATs, Speeder Bikes, Darth Vader's voice...I could go on and on about this unbelievable soundtrack.  Sound is so important to bring a movie to life and Lucas spared nothing on this soundtrack to give these classics a new dynamic feel.Overall, a MUST buy for any Star Wars fan.  These films have never looked or sounded better then they do in this aweinspiring release.  I am going to go out on a limb and say this is by far the best Blu Ray release of the year.  Do not fall into what so many have already done and not buy because of additions to the \"original\" theatrical version.  These additions are minor and do nothing to the overall enjoyment you will feel when watching these films in HD.

She was educated in Oxford and in Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth.Jane Austen's works are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human flaws and personal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters.Jane Austen wrote Sense and Sensibility in 1811, this being her first published novel. This film provides a rare combination of a superb interpretation of the author's novel and a cast that turns it into a masterpiece.In the past, when a wealthy man died, for the most part, the male son would inherit his fortune. In Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen brings forth the terrible consequences of this costume, for Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, become impoverished after her husband dies. As it was expected, John inherites the estate, Norland.John promises his father that he will take care of his sisters and step-mother, but being married to a rather selfish woman, she stops him from doing he horonable thing. So, the Dashwood women are now seen as strangers in their own home and soon set out to find alternative living quarters.The older Dashwood, Elinor is rather taken by the selfish sister in law's brother, a gentle and intelligent young man, who is to marry a woman of high rank, so given that Elinor has sense, she does not hope to see her love aspirations come to fruition.The Dashwood women move to Barton Cottage, where a distant cousin rents them affordable quarters. Marianne is the romantic sister, who upon spraining her ankle, meets a handsome young man who carries her to safety in the rain, and romance appears to strike. But the young man announces that he must return to London on business and the hopes of Marianne are shattered.As Elinor Dashwood, Emma Thompson is powerful, funny as the Dashwood sister that possesses enough sense to enchant us all. Her sister, played by Kate Winslet, is a romantic who attracts several suitors, while Elinor deals with Hugh Grant, the person who ultimately brings this romance to a sheer delight.The costumes are excellent. The setting of the manicured English countryside allows us to see the environment the author intended for the development of her wonderful characters.", "qas": [{"question": "How can I cast a ticket?", "id": "2aa14d0b064e2cf0ba8e755b29b24f56", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "1404918051", "paragraphs": [{"context": "An outstanding romantic comedy, 13 Going on 30, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a 13-year old girl who has her wish fulfilled and wakes up seven years later in the body of her 30-year old self!13 Going on 30 is based on the hit 80's movie \"BIG\" starring Tom Hanks, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.Jennifer Garner (who is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!), Mark Rufallo, Andy Serkis, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.

The cinematography is truly stunning -- Japan is visually fascinating no matter who takes the pictures -- and the costuming is gorgeous. Of course, most of the Gion district of Kyoto no longer exists, but the set construction was entirely convincing.

Ken Watanabe has been a superstar in Japan for years, though not well enough known here. There are numerous other Japanese, Chinese, and Korean actors well known in Asia but not in the U.S., which makes this almost a repertory effort. (Even Mako, veteran of more than 130 movies and television series since the early 1960s, appears in a minor role.) Ted Levine, who plays the American colonel, had me baffled for a minute, before I realized he plays Capt. Stottlemeyer on the \"Monk\" TV series. Actually, my only (minor) complaint is that the early part of the film was a bit muddled because the actors' English pronunciation was shaky; if I hadn't known the plot already, I probably would have gotten quickly lost. Maybe they should have used subtitles in the early part of the film. After Ziyi Zhang took over the role, however, there were no problems.

It's been so long since I have been so taken by a romantic movie, and Brokeback Mountain is as beautiful and emotionally impacting as films like Happy Together(Tony Leung), Intimates(Carina Lau), and The English Patient(Ralph Fiennes). It's such a treat to see Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger under the meticulous direction of Ang Lee. I agree with Lee that this film is a beautiful love story and not a gay cowboy movie.Brokeback Mountain uses the beautiful mountain landscape of Alberta as a stand in for the Wyoming mountains. It's the place where Jack(Gyllenhaal) and Ennis(Ledger) spent their first year in the mid '60s working together as cowboys tending the sheeps. The two lonesome cowboys clashed at first, but eventual became friends and secret lovers. Jack is the sexy and rebellious one, and Ennis is emotionally and sexually confused. At first, they didn't want to acknowledge their feelings for each other, until they were separated for four years, and started to miss each other. During those four years, they both got married and led a \"normal life\", and had kids. Ennis' wife Alma(Michelle Williams) eventually found out that he's cheating on her with Jack, but never actually confronted him until years later. Jack had been relocated to Texas since marrying the beautiful and wealthy Laureen(Anne Hathway).When Jack and Ennis were reunited, it reignited their old passion and lust for each other, and occasionally went up to Brokeback Mountain to have their secret romantic getaways while pretending to be on fishing trips. Jack's feeling for Ennis grew stronger gradually, and suggested to move away and live together. But Ennis has homophobia of his own and fear any possible alienation and condemnation, and just wanted to keep it a \"once in a blue moon\" deal. So time passes by, and twenty years later, they are both middle aged men, still going through the same old pattern. Jack becomes resentful towards Ennis, because he had wasted half of his life loving him and not having him entirely, even when he had already been divorced from Alma for years.This film features a scene stealing Michelle Williams. The scene when Alma saw Ennis kissing and hugging Jack outside her house was so funny and shocking. She was mesmerizing when she had her heart-to-heart confrontation with Ennis. Anne Hathway has less screentime and a less challenging role to work with, and she gets to wear different kinds of wigs. Her final scene when she breaks the tragic news to Ennis was her big moment. I enjoyed watching every scene between Jake and Heath. I actually like Jake's character more, because he knew what he wanted and was not afraid to love the man of his life. I was very moved by his final scene, which was kind of long, but the most dramatic between the two leads. I wished Jake had a few more stronger scenes to work with. It's Heath who actually got the most tear-jerking moments, and yes, his performance is compelling, and heartbreaking, especially the last fifteen minutes.Ang Lee had done a great job making this film visually stunning and emotionally powerful, even though the love scenes are rather low-key. The cinematography captures the most beautiful images of the mountains, sheeps, rivers, and lakes. The original score and theme song are quite memorable.

Even in Atlanta, Georgia it is now playing in one midtown theatre in a neighborhood where there are more rainbow flags visible than flannel shirts.The film is beautiful to watch if a bit too long. That is to be expected since Mr. Lee had the task of fleshing out a short story into a two hour movie. It is easier to express passage of time with two sentences than on the big screen with two characters who essentially are nonverbal, a second problem as the director had to show a lot of what was going on between the two lead actors with only body language and facial expressions. Additionally, in the short story by Annie Proulx that Mr. Lee and Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based this movie on the men are not particularly attractive. For instance, in the Proulx account Jack Twist has buckteeth; there ain't nothing buckteeth about Jake Gyllenhaal's smile. He is almost too handsome although he does put on weight as the years pass by.These are minor complaints, however. The movie should not be missed, not only by gay audiences but by the rest of America as well. Both lead actors do a fine job as do the minor characters, particularly Jack Twist's wife. The message is clear: in 1963 in Wyoming-- as in the rest of America-- two masculine \"Malboro\" men could not have had an open relationship. If they had been hairdressers and town outcasts, maybe. On the other hand, love in whatever form it takes is not to be missed. Isn't that what living is all about anyway?While Mr. Lee, who by the way, is one of our best and most innovative directors-- he never repeats himself-- deviates some from Proulx's story, he keeps the essence of it. In the very end of the movie he adds a poignant touch by having Ennis hang his shirt outside Jack's on the same hanger in his closet, something, as I recall, he does not do in the story.The soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of \"He Was A Friend of Mine.\"We can only hope that the movie gets to a wide audience in Wal-Mart and K-Mart land, where these two men and their families lived.", "qas": [{"question": "How is effect?", "id": "9770b9c20be4419820ae4c284757d196", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I'm glad to have lived long enough to see a movie of such pure greatness!

But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool.

When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.  When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.  A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.  He may not be what we define as gay.  His love is for this man.  With this man gone he may desire no other man.  True love is such a gift and should never be denied.  And shame on anyone who tries to deny others from having it.Here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.  The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.  The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.  Heath Ledger and Jeke Gyllenhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.  The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.  Her journey could have been so stereotypical but in her hands it is a splendind self realized exploration a woman must endure.The story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.  The blu ray version is astounding.  This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.  The 1080p high def picture is astounding.  The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.  The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.This film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.  I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.

Something of an achievement in itself!)Not just bad, but truly, TRULY abyssmal on ALL levels!No one can act, ...no one can sing, no one can dance, (yes, this IS a musical!)...and the leads can barely even skate!The poor extras all work their collective butts off but to little avail.

There's dancing?She can't dance, ....notice how she just runs open-armed through the dance scenes as all the poor extras dance furiously?It's a movie about skating?

And not to forget those ubiquitous damned incongruous LEG-WARMERS with EVERYTHING!Good grief! Just how really tragic were the 80's???Her leading Poonce-Charming is about as charismatic as last weeks cold lasagne, .....blessed with a nose that would be perfect should his role be \"Pinocchio\".(Unfortunately it isn't!)How much money they had to give Gene Kelly to induce him into this crap remains a secret, but it must have been gazillions!He wanders about in some sort of a soporific daze reminiscing about the \"old days\", ...as well he might!

The actress playing Dale Arden (sp?) is painfully bad, especially during the football fight scene where she claps her hands, joyfully egging Flash on with \"Go, Flash, go!  Go, Flash, go!\"  Topol (Fiddler on the Roof) is over-the-top as the mad genius scientist who is the only one on Earth to realize that all of the natural disasters are a direct result of an alien attack.  Max von Sydow plays his villainous role as Ming the Merciless with \"muhahahahaha\" glee.  Timothy Dalton doles out his dalliance as Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.  Brian Blessed is priceless as Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen; how he got through the enitre movie wearing what had to be uncomfortable (and very upsetting) leather shorts is admirable.The effects are cheesy (although, at times, brilliant - The Sea of Fire near the beginning is still eye candy for me).  The acting is campy.  The drama is laughable.So why does it continue to fascinate me?  Despite its horrible trappings as a stand-alone movie, it truly is an embodiment of the Saturday morning serial (which Star Wars PROFESSES to be, but has degenerated into a contest of making something fake look real).  With THAT in mind, the movie plays out as good, cheesy campy fun and always has you wondering how the hero continues to cheat death in a nearly 2-hour movie (as opposed to the next weekly installment).  The matter-of-fact discussions about Earth's imminent destruction, our hero and damsel-in-distress somehow instantly falling in love and the inexplicable onset of early jealousy after having only traded about 10 lines of dialogue, the sometimes brilliant lines of dialogue delivered by Max von Sydow (especially how he discusses with Zarkoff why it's HIS fault that Earth is being destroyed), etc., brews an unusual beverage of serial episode fun that was purely misunderstood back when this was released.

The previous DVD had a terrible transfer (I never knew that space was green, for example).  This looks great.  The picture is clear, clean and the colors are perfect.  The sound is excellent, even on a simple stereo TV.The extras are good but not oustanding.  The director's commentary is entertaining.  The 2nd disk leaves a little to be desired (like the ST1 Director's cut) but is worth your time.The additions to the movie for the director's cut are mostly minor and add very little.  There are a few alternate takes of scenes which are slightly inferior to the original, but only if, like me, you know the dialogue by heart, even to the cadence of the actor's voices (yes, I know, I know).  There is also a little bit of extra dialogue in some scenes.  Nothign to write home about, but interesting nonetheless.Of course, the main reason I give this DVD 5 stars is the movie, which many feel is the best of the series.  It is, as the director envisioned, Horatio Hornblower in Space -- complete with exciting battles and compelling characters.  While the movie is a sequel to an episode of the classic TV series, you will not be lost if you haven't seen it.  I hadn't when I first saw Kahn in 1982 and I had no problem following the plot.In short, the extras and new scenes would not make this DVD worth your money.

Kahn (from the original series) is back and he's not to happy. Once he escaped from his exile, he could go anywhere he wanted to. Instead of doing that, he wants to go after Jim Kirk.

One book that really stands out is Moby Dick, kind of forshadows what's going to happen to him.With all of this is doing on, it seems that some scientists have created something called, \"Genesis\". Genesis can literally create life from nothing. However for this to happen, it has to destroy whatever life in on a planet or moon for this to work. In the wrong hands, it can be a weapon.It's up to Kirk and Company to stop Kahn and to save Genesis.Seeings how this is such a old movie, the transfer to blu ray is beautiful. The sound is crisp and clear and during the battle scenes is very impressive.  The images on this blu ray are fantastic! The images are sharp, crisp and very clear. I was really impressed with how smoothly the transfer really went.  It has some really neat extras that I haven't seen before. I really liked it.I just have one small complaint about the blu ray. The menu screen wasn't all that great. It seems that all of the Star Trek movie menu screens just have the Star Trek symbol, that's it.

The best of the Trek films (I'd put VI in second place), I was stunned to find that this movie I watched over and over growing up had an incredibly moving and thoughtful subtext when I watched it again in college.ST II has some of the best moments in the long history of Star Trek, including what I feel to be Kirk's two greatest moments in his two confrontations with Khan. But the strategies and explosions aside (and those are great in this flick), it goes much deeper.I invite everyone to rewatch The Wrath of Khan purely for the parable about aging, death, and rebirth. Kirk's final words (which I won't reveal here) on the bridge of the Enterprise bring the parable full circle. The film is remarkably deep, I continue to be surprised.Finally, a quick note about the Director's Cut DVD -- it is a gem. The video and audio transfers are great, and definitely take advantage of 5.1 digital surround at a few points in the movie. The picture quality is quite good, and improves by leaps and bounds over that widescreen VHS and the early DVD. The extras are interesting to a point -- the old trailer is hilariously bad, but I could easily do without the \"Hi, I'm a professional Trekkie\" short film.

The infamous score by Harry Manfredini is excellent and scary and carries the film very well. The cast of basic unknowns adds to the sense of isolation that the makers of this film knew was a key element to making it as frightening as it is.Critics love to trash this movie but it must have done something right to spawn more sequels than any other.The plot probably needs no explanation but goes simply like this: Counselors setting up a camp in the middle of the woods are killed one by one in, each in a different grisly manner, but who is doing the killing?Many people take so many aspects of this film for granted because it has been ripped-off so many times (although, to be fair, it is somewhat a rip-off in itself of Halloween - using a holiday and a slasher killing teens). But this film introduced many elements into a genre it would actually almost invent by itself - the slasher film.First off all, we have the wooded setting, next we have a series of gruesome and creative killings (tamed by today's standards), using the camera to make you, the viewer, see the slaying of the victims through the eyes of the killer.The shock-ending of this film was probably the most effective of its kind in movie history and during its run at the theaters, you would inevitably hear a tremendous letout of screams right before the movie ended (I won't mention what this is just on the slight notion that someone doesn't know what I'm talking about). But the reason this scene succeeded so well was simple...because the film effectively created a genuiune feeling of terror and suspense for the first 85 minutes and took viewers by surprise.FRIDAY THE 13TH looks great in this digitally remastered widescreen DVD and helps to eliminate the dated look it was taking on due to increasingly poorer VHS releases. The only special features that this film does have are the trailer (which is not remastered but shows the great contrast between the remastered and unremastered prints) and chapter selection. Unfortunately this is not the un-cut version but for some reason does contain a few extra seconds of blood in one scene (the third killing in the film of Annie) and a few deleted scenes in another (the decapitation near the end of the movie) and also contains a few extra seconds of the sex scene.

You had to be there, but in between Star Trek II and III one had to wonder and debate how are they going to bring Spock back? The guy is dead. It not only makes sense, how they bring him back, but it is the most ingenious idea of the ENTIRE ST movie franchise. It also dips into an essence ingredient of Science Fiction and that is Terra Forming. Genetically altering an environment. I saw this movie in a packed, sold out, theater and when Saavik discovers there is \"life\" coming from Spocks tube/casket...you could here a collective gasp from the audience. Again, you had to be there. It's completely believable in the Star Trek realm.THIS MOVIE has the single greatest on-screen moment of ANY ST movie and that is when Kirks son, David, is murdered. Shatner is brilliant. NO OTHER ST Captain could EVER pull off such a moment. Can anyone see Picard or Janeway in a moment like that? Nope. Can you imagine Picard trying to deal with Kruge? He would want to talk his ear off rather than fight him! That brings me to the last greatest moment of this film...Kruge has clearly KO'd Kirk. But what does Kirk do? He blows up the Enterprise! Fantastic! The shot of the Enterprise blowing up is incredible! Here is this iconic ship, a ship that in Star Trek-The Motion Picture they took great care to show you all of the detail and splendor of this new and improved Enterprise, and in ST III it is just obliterated! Awesome!McCoy delivers the second greatest line of any ST movie and he describes Kirk to a T when they beam down to Genesis and watch fireball that was the Enterprise streak across the sky. Kirk says \"My God, Bones, what have I done?\" and McCoy says \"What you always do...turn death into a fighting chance to live.\" So without THIS MOVIE the Enterprise would never have been destroyed! How many times does TNG rip that off?THIS FILM was Nimoys first Directing job and he does a brilliant job! This DVD features tons of great stuff! Namely, the directors commentary from Nimoy. The only drawback, to Nimoys commentary, is he kind of comes off like an old grandpa telling you the same story you've heard him tell about 100 times. Example: between the featurettes and the directors commentary Leonard tells us no less than FOUR TIMES the story of how Michael Eisner was not going to let him direct the film because of a supposed claus in Nimoys contract that he would only come back if can direct the film.Shatner, on the other hand, is great in the featurettes as he tells of how he put out a fire on the set and how he doesn't \"trust\" Nimoy. Funny stuff, you'll have to buy the DVD to see what I mean.So, if you're not convinced that this is the greatest ST film ever, then you need to look at my review again and see all of the history this movie has created!

There's a little action, a little drama, a little romance, and a little suspense. Elements that, when put together, make this a truly wonderful film.What I liked best was the portrayal of the Amish. Instead of painting them as quaint, sheltered people, the movie concentrates on their values and their mindset. The end result leaves the viewer with a strong feeling that maybe they've been living life the right way, and we've somehow gone astray.The supporting characters (a viscious Danny Glover, small and innocent Samuel, and the old and wise - if a bit stubborn - Eli) are perfect, and lend the movie a almost homey feeling. With the exeption of the villains, most are three dimensional and complex, and play an important role in the story instead of merely being a distraction.I've never seen two stars more perfectly cast than Harrison and Kelly.

Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A new star is discovered near our solar system, on a collision course, approaching fast - VERY FAST! Some amongst scientific community believe it can pass near Earth, close enough to burn all life on our planet - and those are the optimists... Then, a planet orbiting this new star is discovered... I will say no more about the story.This film is based on a popular SF novel written in 1933 and therefore is definitely NOT linked to any kind of Cold War scares, unlike what some critics wrote back in the 50s. Far from being a parabol of nuclear war, both the book and the film are in fact SF variations on the theme of Deluge and Noah's Ark...This review will be short, because I really don't want to give away too much - so let me just say, that this film indeed is aged and yes, the plot has many holes, but it still remains a nice watch and of course a pretty powerful story, with the ending being particularly good.Actors are mostly forgotten today, even if both Richard Derr and Barbara Rush had a long and rather succesfull career, mostly on TV - she also played the main female character in another SF classic from 50s, &#34;It came from Outer Space&#34; (1953). Veteran specialists of second roles, Larry Keating and John Hoyt are in fact even more important in this film than actors who are in principle cast in leading roles.A sequel was planned, to be based on the second part of the book, &#34;After Worlds Collide&#34;, but ultimately the project was abandoned. A remake of this film was considered also already for some time, but for the moment it seems also that all those plans were shelved. And it may be for the better, because this film, with all its weaknesses, still packs some punch and is still a darn good watch.

Campbell's 1938 novella WHO GOES THERE, but it had a special resonance during the cold war, when novels like Heinlein's THE PUPPET MASTERS and flims such as INVADERS FROM MARS and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS were top of mind in pop culture. The 1958 I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE combined the notion with a TRUE ROMANCE spin. Bill (Tom Tryon) and Marge (Gloria Talbott) are eager to be married, but a year later Marge is wondering why Bill isn't the man he used to be before the wedding. One night she follows Bill when he takes a suspicious midnight stroll and discovers the awful truth. Tom is really a monster from outer space.Given that the film is set in 1958, director Gene Fowler and writer Louis Vittes can only do so much with the idea, but even so they make it very clear that Monster Tom and Normal Marge have been giving the sheets a regular work out--enough so that Marge consults a doctor to find out why she isn't pregnant. Once she realizes that Tom isn't Tom, she throws him out of the bed room and into the guest room, and then she begins trying to get the other townfolk to believe her story. Trouble is, she's never sure when she's talking to a human being or a monster! Who can she trust?In a great many ways I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE resembles the Val Lewton films of the 1940s, but whereas Lewton's films were \"B\" budget movies that rose to \"A\" art levels, MARRIED is \"B\" through and through. The plot is clever and the special effects aren't bad for the era, but the script is hokey and the whole thing was clearly shot quickly and with a sharp eye toward expense. Even so, the film does give us a fairly rare opportunity to see Tom Tryon, a startlingly handsome actor and deeply closeted actor whose career quickly stalled--but who went on to write such memorable best sellers as THE OTHER and HARVEST HOME while having torrid affairs with the likes of gay porn star Casey Donovan. Talbott is also a welcome face, a classic \"B\" actress who spent most of her career in television.The DVD doesn't offer anything in the way of bonuses, but the print is crisp and clean. I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE isn't really a gotta-have-it film unless you're a hardcore 1950s B-horror-flick fan, but it is an entertaining (and surprisingly influential) little film that should hold your attention for its fairly brief running time.

If it wasn't for Alien, we wouldn't have Aliens, Alien 3, or Alien: Resurrection. Alien was release in 1979 when all the other space movies were released. However Alien looks at the future space theme much differently then the cliched laser-guns, droids, and aliens who are all humanoid and understand every language. Alien envisions a much more down and dirty theme, with dark claustrophobic corridoors. Alien is the most tense and freaky of the Alien movies, Alien 3 is the only other alien movie that comes close to being as horrific.Alien is better then other sci-fi movies because it is a much more acheivable future with one unique alien. It provides the indistructable image of the alien, which is kind of spoiled by Aliens (one of about the only things that Aliens did wrong). This movie is also the slowest pace of the Alien saga and as a result this film is much scarier then other horror movies. Most other horror movies just have a stupid guy with a bloody knife comming at you, trying to scare you with gore, and as a result, most horror movies are more disgusting then scary. Alien doesn't make this mistake, Ridley Scott is careful not to show too much of the alien because: one-it's easier to see its a guy in a suit if you see it clearly; and two-it adds to the tense atmosphere because your own mind can scare you more then what's on screen. Alien makes you afraid of what could be around the next turn or in the dark corners. Even if you like the gore of other crapy horror movies, alien can still satisfy you with its trade make chestburster scene :)This movie also has some terrific acting, which is important to create the right atmosphere. The music is also important in adding atmosphere; at first this movie has very little music, but as you get more into the movie the music picks up and creates some tense moments. The effects in this movie are also pretty good concidering when it was filmed. I read one review here on Amazon that complained about the effects, and that he could see the strings in every scene, and this is simply not true. The idiot who wrote that review thought he could see the 'strings opporating the alien puppet' and this just proves how stupid this guy is because the alien wasn't even a puppet it was a guy in a suit; so he was clearly out looking for strings and thought he saw some that weren't even there! Oh, and I can never forget about H.R. Giger, the geniouse behind the alien design. If it wasn't for Giger the alien in this film would probably have turned out like every other E.T. or Creature from the Black Lagoon (not that I have anything against these movies); which would probably have kept Fox from ever making the series. Giger also designed the Alien egg, space jockey, the strange planet's surface, the alien ship, the facehugger and the alien chestburster (with assistance).. did I forget anything else? Probably. But don't take my word for it, buy this new DvD. It has a great 'making of' documentary, and two versions of the movie: the theatrical release, and the director's cut (which is pretty much the same as the theatrical release, its just longer with restored scenes!)All in all, Alien is a unique film that I salute for introducing the series, and for being an amazing stand alone movie. I will never stop watching this movie, no matter how old it gets, or how much I memorized the dialogue. If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT NOW! If you haven't seen any of the Alien movies, I STRONGLY recommend that you see this one fisrt. Alien is suitable for anyone who likes any of the following movie genres: science-fiction, horror, suspense, drama, or old classics.

Better than Ridley Scott's original, and I don't say that about many sequels. Beautifully shot with wonderfully dark and claustrophobic cinematography. Sigourney Weaver's performance is sublime, and you can tell she takes her craft very seriously. James Cameron's direction is taut and soaked in adrenalin. On the flip side, Bill Paxton's performance is execrable, though. He never could act, and I was glad when one of the aliens finally dragged his screaming, hysterical butt to his doom, probably just to shut him up. It's nice that there are two versions of the movie to choose from; I prefer the original theatrical version.Transfer quality: Average for Blu-ray, in my opinion. There's a lot of grain in many places. The graininess does add to the dark, foreboding quality of the movie, but to be honest if I had known there would be that much grain I would have just settled for the DVD version. It is possible that the decision to not \"clean up\" the grain was made because often that cleanup process softens the video quality, so maybe it was deliberate. I do appreciate the 1.85:1 aspect ratio - I like having the picture fill the entire screen as opposed to thick black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Audio sounds very good through my home theater system, and is the quality I expect from Blu-ray.Extras - Not too many, not that I expected much in the way of extras in a rock-bottom price Blu-ray. The deleted scenes are always fun to watch, and gets you playing the \"what if\" game - would the movie have been better or worse if the scenes had been left in the original theatrical release? The audio commentaries are somewhat informative, but I never did care for those too much, so I only turn them on for the sake of reviewing a movie here. The isolated James Horner scores are nice to listen to, though.Overall, a great movie and a solid product.

In order to make the deadline for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, at some point in production it was decided to postpone filming the remaining scenes needed for SUPERMAN II until after SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE was finished.However, between 50% and 80% of SUPERMAN II was already filmed by Richard Donner before he was replaced/fired by the Salkinds, the producers / financiers of the films.And although all of his scenes had already been filed, Marlon Brando's footage as Superman's father, Jor-El, was to be cut from SUPERMAN II due to his litigation with the Salkinds and Warners.Richard Lester took over as director for SUPERMAN II, continuing filming in July 1979. Lester actually re-shot several scenes already lensed by Donner. Donner has suggested this was a move by the Salkinds to deny Donner a director's credit; other have suggested that in order for Richard Lester to earn a directorial credit on the film, SUPERMAN II had to contain at least 51% of his footage, necessitating rewrites and reshoots.SUPERMAN II, directed by Richard Lester and released in the US in 1981 (overseas in 1980), contained at least 30% (probably more) footage shot by Richard Donner. Although few people knew it at the time, the released version of SUPERMAN II was drastically different than what Donner originally intended. In fact, it was a completely different film than much of what had originally been filmed for SUPERMAN II.Nevertheless, SUPERMAN II was a box office hit, a critical success, an instant classic and a cherished memory for my generation and the next. I loved the film; have seen it dozens (if not over 100) times and it will always hold a very special place in my heart.But for almost a decade, as the Internet and Web grew, Superman fans were lobbying to see a Richard Donner Cut of S2; including ALL of the footage he (not Lester) shot. Specifically, they wanted to see Donner's original footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, as well as the different scenes that had been replaced / re-shot by Lester. They wanted to see Donner's vision, Donner's intended \"companion piece\" to SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (STM).In 2006, that campaign paid off as Warner Brothers authorized the cut. Over nine months, editor Michael Thau located, restored, cleaned up and assembled the Donner S2 footage - six tons of it --- into a very different version of SUPERMAN II. Using the 1977 SUPERMAN II script penned by Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz (who, uncredited, also penned the screenplay for STM), Thau re-edited the film, and added several newly-filmed shots with CGI enhancements.Thau did a commendable job creating a \"new\" film version of S2 as close to Donner's original vision as possible some 25 years later. The film still included Lester footage, but had a decidedly different feeling and was very much a new film, much more in tone with the first Superman film, much more of a true \"part two\" to the original film. Over 50% of the RDC was footage never before seen.Part of my difficulty with reviewing the Richard Donner Cut of SUPERMAN II is that I know the original Lester-directed S2 so well (OK, I can quote the entire movie) that comparison is inevitable and unavoidable, and in some cases I balk when I see how different some scenes are. Some scenes feel \"wrong\" only because I am used to seeing them presented in the Lester S2 way. I had that knee-jerk reaction several times - hey, that's not the next scene! Where's the Eiffel Towel sequence? Where's the jump into Niagara's Great Gorge? Where's, \"General, would you care to step outside?\"Getting past that, the RDC is a very good - but not great - film. There's a lot to like, there's a lot to love, but there are also some parts to dislike and some questionable choices.After 25 years, it's unfair to say which film is \"better\" because we've known the Lester cut of S2 since 1981, and it was professionally polished, scored and finished, whereas the RDC is still, in some ways, a fan edit, complete with questionable editing choices in places, pacing issues, and poor music choices in other scenes. Despite being a finished product, there is a somewhat \"unfinished\" and \"rushed\" quality to it. And it can certainly be argued that most of the flaws in the RDC can be attributed to the fact that it wasn't finished in the first place.All that said, S2: The Richard Donner Cut is a treasure and Michael Thau has pulled the proverbial rabbit out of his hat and given Superman fans a true Christmas present. Considering the age (and disorganization) of the original footage, that Thau could produce a coherent, nearly complete Donner cut is a hell of an achievement that should not be understated. On the whole, his effort paid off handsomely. And he clearly put a lot of thought (and dare I say, love) into his efforts.There is so much about the RDC that is far superior to the Lester version of S2 -- the interaction between Margot Kiddor and Christopher Reeve seems so much more natural and fun, and anything with Brando as Jor-El is better than what Lester re-shot. The fact that these Brando scenes were ever cut is a crime. Brando makes this movie, and among other things, the inclusion of the Brando footage gives real weight and emotion to certain key scenes, and even finally answers exactly how Superman gets his powers back at the Fortress of Solitude.Yes, the RDC is a mixed bag, and as one reviewer said, \"It is the ultimate deleted scene.\" But it's much more than that. It's the answer to a wish, a look into what could have been, and like most wishes, both good things and not so good things occur when a wish is granted.On that note, let's discuss specifics.THE GOOD (AND THE GREAT):The film is dedicated in loving memory of Christopher Reeve. In the audio commentary, Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz speak so fondly of Reeve. Very appropriate, very touching.I thought Donner's thank you video to the fans at the top of the film was very classy.As the villains break free from the Phantom Zone; Zod shouts, \"Freeeeeeeee!\" and the credits roll. Powerful! Scary! Throughout the entire RDC, the villains are much more serious, much more menacing. There is real danger here. All of the Lester slapstick and nonsense has been removed. The \"cute\" villain moments are gone. I'm amazed how such subtle editing changed the Zoners from campy to deadly.After the credits, the film opens with the New York skyline and a new image of the World Trade Center. It's a little jarring to see the WTC in a \"new\" film post September 11, but the twin tower's construction was completed in 1973, just four years before Superman was filmed. No effort was made to remove the WTC from the film, and I am grateful for that. Whether it's the Lester cut or Donner cut, visually SUPERMAN II is clearly a period piece set in the late 1970s and to remove the iconic WTC would be wrong.In a many of the scenes we have previously viewed, Thau uses different angles of the same take. Nice touch and adds to the \"new film\" feeling.The new opening at the Daily Planet in which Lois sees Clark's resemblance to Superman - fantastic. Reeve and Kidder look like they had so much fun filming this scene--it's playful, immediately shows Lois Lane is nobody's fool, and demonstrates how well Reeve played Clark Kent. Donner's direction really shows here.The additional banter between Lex and Eve is hilarious. Lex's comment that you never use the words \"Lex and Wrong\" in the same sentence is great. Some of their scenes go on a little too long, but usually they're worth it.Every scene with Brando as Jor-El is better than the Lester scene where he was replaced, although Susannah York DID do a great job in the Lester version of S2. Having Brando back as Jor-El adds such strong (and needed) continuity to the first film.Superman's identity revealed: Even though it's two different screen tests and Chris Reeve is probably 20 pounds lighter and made up differently in one half of it, the merged Donner scene in which Lois fires the gun at Clark, who is forced to reveal his true identity, is excellent. After Clark removes his glasses and admonishes Lois that had she been wrong, Clark Kent would be dead, Lois deadpans, \"With a blank?\" and then she smiles. \"Gotcha.\" Brilliant writing and execution.However: Although this Donner scene is superior to the Lester revelation scene where Clark trips over the pink polyester bear rug, one crucial aspect the Donner screen test lacks is the follow-up between Clark and Lois. In the Lester version, after Clark has tripped and fallen and plunged his hand into the fireplace, his glasses come off and Lois yelps, \"Clark! Let me look at it!\" Clark fumbles to put his glasses back on and hide his uninjured hand but Lois can see he's not burned at all. It's an emotional scene, well acted, and tender.I miss that beautiful scene. Despite the setting - a garish polyester honeymoon suite - the acting is intense, sincere, and some of Kidder and Reeve's best work in the series and a triumph for Lester. It's a shame some sort of meld of the Donner scene with this Lester scene wasn't possible, but it would be too jarring.When the villains arrive in Midwestern America, the removal of the Lester lame humor and sight gags is very welcome, improves the movie dramatically, and gives the villains a FAR more menacing quality.The exchange where Jor-El warns Superman of the dangers of falling in love is powerful. This scene's exclusion in the original S2 is inexcusable and wrong. Brando is brilliant here. He is PLEADING with his son not to give up his powers.Think, Kal-El! I beg you! Think!And when Jor-El ask him, \"Is this how you repay their gratitude? By abandoning the weak, the defenseless, the needy - for the sake of your selfish pursuits?\" I loved Superman's incredulous, \"Selfish, after all I've done for them? At least they have a chance for happiness! I only ask the same, nothing more.\" is excellent. And there's Lois, after making love to Superman, wearing only Superman's shirt and socks, watching. As Superman's powers are destroyed, Jor-El just stares at her hatefully- and she backs up, terrified. Love it.Great addition: General Zod smiling as he shoots people with the machine gun. Really shows how evil he is.Now we come to the money scene--A powerless and bruised Superman arrives at the Fortress of Solitude. (Only gripe--Lester's choice to darken the fortress a deep, gloomy green is much more effective than Donner's choice to keep the Fortress all lit up. In the Lester version, the fortress is dark green, cold and dead. Visually it made more sense.)That quibble aside, this is THE scene we have waited to see, and it was SO worth the wait. Jor-El appears, speaks to Superman, and dies in order to restore his son's powers.Superman: \"Father... I failed, I failed you, I failed myself and all humanity. I traded my birthright for a life of submission in a world that is now ruled by your enemies. There's no one left to help them now, the people of the world, not since I... FATHER!\"The Green crystal glows... He picks it up, inserts it into the control panel... He's shivering...Jor-El: \"Listen carefully, my son, for we shall never speak again. If you hear me now, then you have made use of the only means left to you - the crystal source through which our communication was begun. The circle is now complete. You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El. You have abandoned the world for the sake of private ambition. You did this of your own free will, and in spite of all I could say to dissuade you. Now you have returned here to me for one last chance to redeem yourself. This too - finally - I have anticipated, my son. (pause) Look at me, Kal-El... Once before, when you were small, I died while giving you a chance for life. And now, even though it will exhaust the final energy left within me... Look at me, Kal-El!... The Kryptonian prophecy will be at last fulfilled. The son becomes the father - the father becomes the son. Goodbye forever, Kal-El. Remember me, my son...\"And Jor-El appears in corporeal form and lays his hand on Superman's shoulder, as Superman shudders and white light engulfs him.IN-CRED-IBLE. This is the CORE of the father-son relationship theme of both films. The acting is compelling, poetic, and strong.HOW COULD THEY CUT THIS SCENE IN THE LESTER VERSION?Back in Metropolis...The battle has started! Great moment: Jimmy re-entering the office with Perry's coffee and Lex steals it out of his hand. Jimmy argues that the coffee was the Chief's and Lex counters calmly that, \"The Chief's got it.\"I loved the new edits -- during the battle over Metropolis, the focus in on what's going on at the Daily Planet, especially with Jimmy, Lois and Perry--not on stupid sight gags and goofy slapstick humor, or people we don't care about (like Luanne).The battle over Metropolis, with a few exceptions, is pretty much the same, mostly Richard Lester footage and very good. Glad to see the slapstick (such as the guy on the phone continuing the conversation after his phone booth is knocked over and blown away) have been removed. This Lester-filmed battle was always VERY good, and Donner's inclusions of the few battle shots he filmed (such as Superman hitting and destroying the Statue's of Liberty's torch) is very cool.The final confrontation at the Fortress is far better than the Lester version. No silly \"ray-beam\" or \"invisible\" powers, no ripping the S-shield into a piece of cellophane. We just have Zod tell Superman, very matter-of-factly: \"Your father once condemned us to eternal living death. Your fate shall be the same. You will live, Kal-El. Forever - as my slave. If not, then others will pay for your stubborn attitude. Innocent people, millions of them if necessary --- Beginning with her.\" and he nods to Lois.And in this edit of the film, that's all it takes, Given everything we've seen, we KNOW Zod will literally destroy the world to get his way. He's THAT dangerous.Impressive.After the final battle, Superman destroys the fortress and he and Lois end their relationship:SUPERMAN: \"Look, Lois, I...\"LOIS: (brave smile) \"Hey. No... regrets, you know? I mean I did it, didn't I? I got the man I love to love me?\"SUPERMAN: (Sincerely) \"Oh, yeah.\"LOIS: \"So okay, then. So they need you too. I'd be buying my personal little rainbow at the cost of all those people who say, \"Help, come quick ... you think I don't understand that? It's the old eternal triangle, right? Except in my case I've got all of humanity in the next bedroom.\"SUPERMAN: \"We'll see each other. All the time, like before. But it can't be like...\"LOIS kisses him passionately. He responds in spite of himself. They break. She looks up at him, trembling.LOIS: \"Just don't forget, that's all.\"Poetic, beautifully written and acted. Powerful. Poignant.Finally, the new wrap-up at the Daily Planet is very sweet, really showing the fondness Lois has for Clark, and I liked his offer to pay for the pizza. Just a sweet scene.Now we move on to the ... NOT SO GOOD:Many of my complaints about the RDC have already echoed by reviewers nationwide. The recap of the events in STM is just too long--well over five minutes. Lester's recap in S2 - with the credits interweaved with the relevant events of the first movie - worked much better even though it ran in about the same time.Bathroom humor. Why? Why in the world restore the god-awful bathroom humor? In prison, \"Slasher Folgelstein is a bed-wetter.\" \"Did you go pssht?\" \"Why didn't you go before we left?\" And the absolute worst - a toilet flushing sound in the fortress of solitude. It's beyond juvenile - it's painful.The Music - Thau elected to reuse the John Williams score from the first film rather than the Ken Thorne composition of the Williams music from S2. The result is a decidedly mixed bag. The music just feels wrong in some places, or the wrong piece of music was chosen in many places. Since all the music is \"reused\" and wasn't written with S2 in mind, it never quite dovetails and is actually distracting in some places.Luthor's escape from Prison is waaaaayyyyyy too long.Editing / pacing: Maybe it's just that I know the Lester version of S2 too well, but some of the editing is just not too good. The smash cut to Niagara Falls is jarring, and in some cases the editing is a little distracting. The pacing is a little slow, and in this new film, Superman (in costume) doesn't appear in new footage until 40 minutes into the film, unlike the Lester version of S2 where Kent switches to Superman the first three minutes of the film.The courtship dinner at the fortress is cut before Lois says, \"I'm going to change into something more comfortable\" and feels rushed.There are two instances where Superman's \"S\" is clearly backwards. Sorry, but that's just sloppy.Biggest gripe of all--Superman turns the world around to reverse time - AGAIN? I understand that this was the original ending of S2, and at some point the decision was made to move this effect to the first film. In the Lester version of S2, Kent gives Lois the much-derided \"memory erasing kiss\" but everyone else remembers the attack of the Phantom Zone villains. In this movie, Superman reverses time to the point where the Donner Cut of the movie never even happens. I understand Donner would have come up with a new ending for SUPERMAN II had he been allowed to continue, but the time-reversal thing in two movies feels worse than a cheat.On that note, as many reviewers have said, if Superman has reversed time, why does everyone at the diner recognize him at the end of the film? Sure, it brings emotional closure to have Kent give Rocky the bully a taste of his own medicine, but in this \"new timeline\" the two have never met.However...HOW I WOULD HAVE ENDED THE DONNER CUT:REMOVE THE TURN-BACK-TIME GIMMICK COMPLETELY.After the Fortress battle...The Phantom Zone villains and Luthor are taken away by the Artic police. Why relegate this to the \"Deleted Scenes\" section?Superman destroys the fortress, and Lois and Superman end their relationship in the arctic.After Lois and Superman speak on her balcony, he flies off and DOES NOT TURN TIME BACKWARD. Since Lois has clearly accepted the reality of the situation, there is no need to make her forget anything. They're both adults. She understands. It would play so much better.Lois begins typing \"Superman saves the world\"Scrap the new Daily Planet scene. Since Superman didn't turn back time it would no longer make sense and isn't necessary to further the plot.Then, Kent returns to the diner and gets his revenge on Rocky.Superman flies the flag back to the White House (Lester footage but very symbolic and powerful)Superman flies into space / end credits.For me, it would just work better. Forget continuity (Lois knowing the secret). Superman III and SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE are forgettable and SUPERMAN RETURNS is a \"vague sequel\" anyway.SUMMARYIt would be unfair to take away anything from Richard Lester for his version of S2. While I don't agree with some of his choices and re-shoots, despise the slapstick humor (and SUPERMAN III - Lester's baby start to finish -- was horrible) Lester arguably did his best with what he had to work with in an awkward situation back in 1979, and many of his choices for \"his\" S2 were very good and overall, his version of S2 holds up very well even after all these years. I still love it; it's still a classic. The revelation to Lois, the powerless Superman returning to the dark, empty fortress, \"General, would you care to step outside?\" the Niagara Falls rescue, the Great Gorge jump, the majority of the battle over Metropolis are all Lester footage and very well done.I miss the entire Paris scene at the Eiffel Tower. I miss Kent running into the alley at the top of the film, ripping open his shirt to reveal the \"S\" and blurring at super-speed into Superman. It's a great effect, iconic. A few minutes into the Lester film, Superman is flying to the rescue. That moment ranks as one of my favorites in the entire series. In the Donner cut, we never see Kent change to Superman.And so I would be remiss if I did not say, thank you Richard Lester, for your Superman II. I still love it, warts and all.Two visions of the same film--both with great strengths and certain weaknesses and distractions.So much of the RDC is brilliant and one can really see how this \"true companion piece\" to STM would have unfolded.Had Donner been allowed to complete his version of S2 back in 1979, the issues with music and pacing and editing wouldn't exist. So while this review mentions the editing/pacing/music issues with this cut, it is certainly understood they would have been corrected in a perfect world.No matter what, Michael Thau has done a terrific job and made our dream come true. Many thanks to him, as well as Warner Brothers, for making it possible to see Richard Donner's original vision of S2.Thank you to all the fans who lobbied for this version of the film.And to Richard Donner, there are no words to thank you for all you have done to define Superman for generations to come. Thank you for your dedication, determination, and your vision. And thank you to everyone (especially Michael Thau) responsible for bring this restored vision of S2 to life. It was well worth the wait.", "qas": [{"question": "What will this make me aware of about people?", "id": "563b57b8f95ce3d5a9b066ccc12a2b96", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "6300271285", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This really is a fun movie.

(You can sort by &#8220;newest first&#8221;. With that said, on to my review of the 50th Anniversary RESTORED Blu-ray Combo.Disney repackagings it&#8217;s classic films about every 10 years for their &#8220;Anniversary Editions&#8221;.  They usually add a new &#8220;special feature&#8221; or two and repeat the ones from prior editions. For the first Blu-ray release of MP they went the extra step and digitally remastered the film. They did an amazing job on it and, even on a basic HD flat screen TV &#8211; the images are super sharp and the colors brilliant.There were two reasons to release this &#8220;Special Edition&#8221; now (three, if you consider that it&#8217;s Christmas gift time). One is the 50th anniversary of the film&#8217;s release (which is stretching it a bit since the 50th won&#8217;t come until next year (2014). The other is the December 2013 release of the Disney feature film &#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; about the making of MP. And, trust me, Disney did not miss this opportunity to cross-market both films. The &#8220;Exciting New Content&#8221; on this 2013 package includes &#8220;Becoming Mr. Sherman&#8221; an new 11-minute featurette with actor Jason Schwartzman (who plays composer Richard Sherman in SMB) chatting with the real Richard Sherman. I can already see this being a &#8220;bonus&#8221; on the SMB DVD when it is released in 2014. This is followed by the 2 1/2 &#8211;minute &#8220;trailer&#8221; for SMB. The other &#8220;Exciting New Content&#8221; is the &#8220;Mary-oke&#8221; which shows the animated lyrics to four songs on the screen so you can sing along.All the other bonues (and there are many) are carried over from prior editions and titled &#8220;Classic Bonuses&#8221;. These include a 48 minute feature on bringing MP to Broadway (with the full 7-minute production number of &#8220;Step In Time&#8221;), a 50-minute &#8220;Making of&#8221; the film featurette, A 9-minute Pl&#62; Travers story told by Julie Andrews and a full length commentary with Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Richard Sherman. Considering that the film runs 2  hours, this means that there is over SEVEN-HOURS (!) of entertainment on this BD.You may already own a copy of the earlier edition and not need the &#8220;Classic Bonuses&#8221; again. And the &#8220;Becoming Mr. Sherman&#8221; bonus is really an infomercial for SMB (which I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing next week), but if you have a Bluray player, I feel it&#8217;s worth upgrading to this new edition, if only to enjoy the new crisp images from the latest restoration. (Then give your older edition to someone who has yet to experience the magic of this film.)I&#8217;ll end by saying that the film is not just for children. There are moments of humor that only an adult will notice and &#8211; until I watched it again yesterday &#8211; I didn&#8217;t realize how little dialogue there is in the film; it&#8217;s mostly songs and production numbers!

Get this...Hollywood, 1947: Humans share their world with living animated characters dubbed 'Toons.  Brilliant!  And it must be said that it would not be so brilliant if the effects were any less than they are.  The filmmakers have done the miraculous, by seemlessly combining cartoons and live-action.  You thought the combination MARY POPPINS or BEDKNOBS &amp; BROOMSTICKS was flawless?  Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.  You are truly swept away into this world, and never, not EVER, do you stop to consider how this is possible.  But the film is far from just an excuse to show off effects (like so many modern films are).  No, the plot keeps you guessing, and everything is so compliated and fits so well together that I keep understanding more and more every single time I watch it!  The actors are extremely talented, and work so well with their animated co-stars it's nothing short of mind-boggling.  Bob Hoskins is very entertaining as anti-sober P.I. Eddie Valiant, and Christopher Lloyd shines as Judge what's-his-name.  But, of course, the real star of the show is Roger himself; his mere existence is a masterpiece of idiocy!  And I could not possibly write a review for this film without mentioning Jessica Rabbit.....without a doubt the hottest cartoon to appear on paper/the silver screen.  A highly recommended film, and an absolute must-see!I'd only owned one VISTA Series title before buying WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, and that was TOMBSTONE: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.  While that DVD had a spectacular transfer with seamless picture/sound quality, I was a bit disappointed with the extras.  It is the same with this one.  Though the picture quality isn't what I'd call seamless, it's the best the film's ever looked (at least since it's original release).  The sound quality is fine, however.  The special features, while informative, are not up to the preferred standard.  Then again, all special features seem this way after owning/viewing The Extended Edition of LOTR!Conclusion:  If you're a fan of Robert Zemeckis...well, this is one of his most famous (and certainly most ground-breaking) films!

The title characters, Pat and Billy, are old friends but in 1881 in New Mexico they find themselves on opposite sides of the law.  A group of rich cattle barons/land owners hires Pat Garrett as sheriff to hunt down and kill his friend and outlaw Billy the Kid who has been rustling cattle.  Just like Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch, this movie deals with the changing times of the west; Garrett tries to change with the times while Billy refuses to change for anyone.  Peckinpah takes his time with the movie as the story just ambles along until the climax.  The movie features plenty of balletic, slow-motion violence that Peckinpah has become famous for.  Bob Dylan's soundtrack is pretty good, but it seems out of place at certain points.  Either way, this is an another excellent movie from Bloody Sam that western fans will appreciate.James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson are excellent in the title roles as Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.  Coburn brings a great amount of world-weariness as Garrett while Kristofferson gives Billy a human side in a part that could have been nothing more than a stereotype.  Singer Bob Dylan is surprisingly good as Alias, a mysterious gunfighter who serves as a go-between with Pat and Billy.  The supporting cast is an impressive collection of western character actors including Chill Wills, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Richard Jaeckel, Luke Askew, Jason Robards, RG Armstrong, Emilio Fernandez, Paul Fix, Harry Dean Stanton, and Gene Evans.  This VHS is the original uncut version that Peckinpah originally intended so if you can get your hands on a copy, take it.  Beware of the VHS release that cut twenty minutes for time.

Shadow and light and camera direction are well-used to show how different the stranger seems to the others in the film, even though he looks like an ordinary human being to the viewer. The choice of an unknown was a brilliant means to ensure the interplanetary visitor was a stranger...unfortunately for Mr.Rennie, his career did so poorly he's a stranger for us, too.

Beauty and the Beast is a film for all ages and although it's only 19 years old, it will be an eternal classic for years to come. This new Diamond Edition makes Beauty and the Beast better than ever.Beauty and the Beast comes to Blu-Ray looking fantastic. I think no traditional-animated film has looked better. It looks brand-new with no dirt, no edge enhancement, no grain and no artifacts to be found in the print. You will be surpriused with the rich color palette that the film has and the huge amount of detail of the drawings. This Blu-Ray transfer does justice to the animators work in te film. The sound is equally impressive with a 7.1 HD sound that will rock your house. Dialogue is clear, the songs sound beautiful and the score is magnificent. This film presentation is absolutely like the movie itself. Simply astounding.As with the previous platinum DVD release, you have three versions of the film to choose: the theatrical 1991 version, the extended 2002 version (which is the version I prefer because Human Again is a fantastic number) and the Work in Progress version. Aside from the three presentations, you have a lot of bonus material (and I mean a lot!!).In disc one you have an audio-commentary, a conversation with legend compososer Alan Menken and a feature that's called Broadway Beginnings which features different stage actors that have been part of the Beauty and the Beast musical on Broadway. Rounding up Disc one is an alternate opening and a deleted scene (which are a little long but great to see).If you are still thirsty for more (and you should be), in Disc Two you'll find the inmmersive documentary Beyond Beauty. Just like the Hyperion Studios documentary in Snow White, this feaure covers everything that concerns the making of the film. You need a lot of your time to see everything here but is pelnty of fun and very informative. You also have some games and the Classic DVD Bonus Features ported from the Platinum DVD.A DVD copy is also offered. It also has the three versions of the film plus the audiocommentary and looks great for SD (better than the platinum) but it's a far cry from the quality of the Blu-Ray.Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film and a must-own for everyone. This Diamond Edition is a no-brainer purchase or upgrade and you should buy it. An excellent edition for an Exellent film.

She is a marvelous protagonist because so many can relate to her. Yes, Belle is a dreamer but also has a strong, courageous heart to make her dreams come true. She is inspiring because she maintains a balance of her desires for a better life by finding  some joy in every day, no matter what the circumstances are.One day, through an unexpected turn of events, she finds herself locked in a dungeon for the sake and love of her elderly father.  I like how she thinks of him before herself.  That is love.  Only when the Beast, a cruel and hideous monster who once was a prince, (and still is but must find a way to bring out the good in his heart for all to see to break the spell) sends her father away and she doesn't get to say goodbye, does she realize the permanence of her decision.  She has lost \"her father, her freedom and her dreams in one day.\" However, dreams have a way of never dying.  As long as they are alive in our hearts there is always Hope.  I love the way throughout this movie this theme of hope and patience is repeated over and over.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has it all--fantastic characters (I love them all, even the bad ones, but must say, besides Belle and the Beast, I love Lumiere the best) and the voices, lively entertainment, a beautiful soundtrack (along with a new song \"Human Again\",) a new full sequence of \"Be Our Guest\" (well done!) and the rainbow of emotions conveyed: longing, fear, anger, sadness, smiles, laughter, loyalty, looking on the bright side, being courageous and having hope and patience. Also, I love to witness the contrast between the good and bad characters in Disney movies. What a great character study, always! But the transition of the Beast into a true prince at heart, is my favorite to watch; all it took was the right person to help him see the Beauty IN the Beast!I deeply appreciate BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and movies like it which are wonderful reminders of so many valuable lessons:1.) Don't judge a person solely by their outward appearance but by their heart. The inner person of the heart--that is who one really is. The heart can not be hidden, it WILL be revealed, but we must have patience to wait for this.2.) Trust your heart and listen to it--Always.3.) With patience and love, your dreams can come true.4.) Never stop believing in yourself first. Because then no matter how things turn out, you are strong and proud of yourself.5.) Remember that showing kindness and compassion to others is the key to inner peace and true happiness. Life isn't about receiving but about giving--of ourselves.I applaud Disney on this excellent movie about following your heart even when it is difficult, because with enough heart and patience, everything in your life can turn around. 10/10 stars.  Thank you, Amazon. Red roses for everyone involved in this awesome, inspiring movie that won the Golden Globe for Best Picture.Soar!", "qas": [{"question": "Is black muy nice?", "id": "28bcff889e1653ac69e57c9e5cb6168f", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "6302548748", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This is obviously one of the best Civil War films ever made, with only Glory rivaling it.

The first film has a number of strong moments but, ultimately, both Michael and Kaye's characters are underwritten. Overall, the tone and writing are amazingly consistent from film to film. The picture and sound quality is truly outstanding. Coppola's comments are very interesting and add depth to the film.The second film tends to be the strongest of the series. All the characters are more fully realized and have clearer motivation. The picture quality for the second film is stunning given the age of the negative. Both the sound and picture have been cleaned up for DVD release.The third film is a bit more problematic. Coppola's operatic finale to the Godfather saga sags a bit because of all the plot threads he tries to resolve. Nevertheless, Coppola and his collaborator Puzo manage to pull it all together.Andy Garcia is well cast although under used in his role. Sophia Coppola doesn't have the strong acting skills of Winona Ryder (originally castin the film) but she still manages to pull off her role with grace. Yes, she's miscast and yes, she's out of her element given the actors she's working with but given that this is her debut she does a credible job.The strongest parts of the third film are the various set pieces. The attempted assination at the opera is brilliantly realized. Pacino gives an admirable performance as Michael. The film really could have used Robert Duvall in his role as Tom the family attorney (he was holding out for more money and took Days of Thunder instead). George Hamilton gives a credible performance but, again, lacks the screen presence of Duvall. I don't doubt there would have been more cinematic sparks flying if Pacino and Duvall had appeared on screen together again. It's clear that when Duvall turned down the role, the part was reduced and rewritten for Hamilton.The three films together work much better than the three alone. Even if Coppola didn't intend this to be a trilogy when he started out, all three films benefit from the ability to watch the characters grow.", "qas": [{"question": "How was color ?", "id": "973ffb53de2687941dd669324df9c471", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Everybody who is anybody knows how outstanding the first two movies are. They are widely considered in many circles to be two of the ten greatest films ever made, and deservedly so. I mean, it actually merits the overused description of cinematic genius in every way, and absolutely nothing can reduce the scope of this brilliantly dark and legendary Sicilian saga. When I bought this set, I had extremely high hopes for their content, and I must say I was not at all disappointed. The movies look beautiful, the sound is crystal clear, and the features are damn good too.From its incredible story to its artistic splendor to its career-launching performances, the original 'The Godfather' has everything that a truly great American gangster film should have. Marlon Brando, in the role of the aging Don Vito Corleone, is absolutely hypnotizing, in even the slightest mood or gesture. His prescence in unmistakeable. Of course, that doesn't at all undermine the heart and guts that Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and the rest of the cast put into their performances. It is all-at-once a story about family, as well as a sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America, with so many oft-quoted lines and instantly recognizeable scenes, undoubtedly one of the most startling and ingenious films Hollywood has ever seen. Whew! Now, it seems impossible, but 'The Godfather Part II' actually met the standard set by the original, some would say it even surpassed it. It serves as both a prologue and a sequel, masterfully intercutting between the rise of youthful Don Vito Corleone to Mafia chief in the early 1900s in the Little Italy section of New York City and the career of Corleone's son Michael in the late 1950s from his patriarchal prime to his decline a year later. Robert De Niro gives an uncommonly subtle performance as Vito Corleone, struggling to provide for his family in turn-of-the-century immigrant life, eventually finding himself lured into a life of crime. Al Pacino is staggeringly good once again as Michael, but probably the most overlooked performance is John Cazale as his pathetic and whimpering brother Fredo. His every word and mistake, is almost heartbreaking. 'Part II' is much more somber in its tone and almost feels like Greek tragedy, as Michael Corleone, knowing it is his destiny to lead the family, inevitably finds himself unable to come to grips with his demons, leaving him contemplative and spiritually-broken. If that doesn't give you chills and make you say \"Dayyyum!\" then you just don't understand great poignant art. As for 'The Godfather Part III'. Ah, I don't know, it's good, and I suppose it is somewhat underrated. After all, living up to the standard set by the first two is a damn-near impossible feat. Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda both turn in good work, and Sofia Coppola isn't nearly as bad as she has been made out to be. There are a few memorable scenes and Pacino did give us one of the most oft-quoted lines of the '90s (\"Just when I thought I was out... they pulled me back in.\") but it was just bookending it too quickly.I'm very happy with this set, and I think the film company did a beautiful job in their presentation of this trilogy. I particularly liked watching the Oscar acceptance speeches. Coppola is such an exuberant and excitable fella, its hard to believe a seemingly-regular person was the driving force behind these two larger-than-life masterpieces. I do think its kind of odd that neither of the two actors that won Oscars for any of the films, were present to accept their award at the Academy Awards telecast of 1972 and 1974. That really makes me wonder, because it seems that rarely happens anymore. Alright, I think I've said enough now, so I'll end by saying that this set is definitely worth what they're charging (an arm and a leg), because this trilogy belongs in even the most casual film fans' collection.", "qas": [{"question": "What was the best set to shoot this movie?", "id": "bfa38566ca6a7bdc8a31b86bd0baf08f", "answers": [{"text": "outstanding the first two movies are", "answer_start": 35}]}]}]}, {"title": "6302760046", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Ok.

I was glad to see this movie get Disney's Platinum treatment -- it's my favourite Disney film, and getting to watch this new, restored DVD took me right back to being six years old and seeing it for the first time.There's real magic in this movie, something that I feel Disney's lost in the last few years. Aladdin is a great hero, relying on his brains and wit rather than brute strength and a sword, and his opposite number is absolutely insidious, a true love-to-hate villain. Robin Williams as the Genie is outstanding, and I know I've come to appreciate his humour a lot more as I've gotten old enough to understand all the references he makes in his wonderful ad-libbed tangents. Alan Mencken's score is just fabulous -- sweeping and epic, with songs that are both touching and humours by turns. \"One Jump Ahead\", \"Friend Like Me\", and \"Prince Ali\" delight and amuse, while the \"One Jump Ahead\" reprise offers pathos to Aladdin's character. And of course, the show-stopping \"A Whole New World\" still makes my heart soar and my inner romantic swoon gloriously. It's far and away my favourite Disney love song.My favourite thing about this movie, though, is and has always been Jasmine. She was the first heroine I really admired, because she was the first to take her destiny into her own hands and really go for what she wanted. She's strong, intelligent, and independant -- and she had a temper, and yelled, which always made me like her a lot more than those sweet, softspoken, entirely too passive heroines of earlier years. Her yearning for freedom, her desire to be her own person -- those are things I've come to appreciate a lot more as I've gotten older. She's so appealing, and a great role model for little girls -- certainly moreso than other heroines who would try to teach our daughters that they should be quiet and gentle and let the men do all the adventuring!This is my favourite Disney movie, and it's still highly entertaining, even after so many years.

Last, hats off for making an entertaining movie  without the big budget.That's where &quot;Clerks&quot; is a winner.  It's not big-budgeted, you get non major names to play roles.

The more  believable these actors are to their characters, the more humorous the  movie was for me.As for quality video and audio, this was a low budget  movie, so I wasn't going to expect any major video/audio at all.  As for  the special features, the audio commentary was funny but terrible in a way  that you can't really hear the actors speak.  It's like one microphone was  being used. This was a big minus for the DVD.  Why put it in there if you  can't hear it that well.  The alternate ending was a shock and it's very  good they didn't include it in the final release.  It would of made the  movie very depressing.  The Soul Asylum music video rocked and how it stays  with the &quot;Clerks&quot; theme made watching the music video that much  more enjoyable.

You have deprived yourself of one of the best indie films of the 1990s, not to mention one of the better gut buster comedies ever!  \"Clerks\" is the first (major) project by Kevin Smith and it follows the lives of a few New Jersey based characters, but mainly Dante.  Dante is a clerk in a convenience store and he pretty much hates his miserable job, which is destroying him slowly.  His spicy little girlfriend encourages him to go back to school.  Randal, his outspoken best friend and a worker at the video store next door, tires to help out his bud but often helps to paint Dante into a corner.  Also, Randal's definition of friendship is wavy. You wouldn't think that a little quick-stop store would be much for an exciting adventure, but craziness does ensue as both Dante and Randal meet an annoying cast of customers (most notably Jay and Silent Bob) and somehow manage to squeeze a hockey game and a funeral into the day.

The other characters were fun to watch coming to life.  The period costumes and the scenery of the British countryside are second to none.  Absolutely gorgeous!  As for the actual DVD, I agree with the people who say that the special A&E DVD edition isn't very good.  The picture quality left a lot to desire and the bonus features aren't any better.  That is why I give this DVD four stars instead of five.  Five stars for the series itself and two stars for the DVD.

Wonderfully done, but I do not recommend watching it all in one sitting as I had to do! This Jane Austen story examines the prejudices between classes in the 19th century and the pride that keeps lovers apart. It is an epic journey of romance, very gradual, no love at first sight here but a lot more realistic perspective on how affection develops and true love forms set in a time of manners and period dress and culture.Fifteen years later, this adaptation of the Jane Austen novel still holds up very well. Set in the first decade of the 19th century, it has an authentic look and feel in set, costumes, and manners. More impressively, the characters are able to take these complicated, beautifully written but difficult to say lines and present them with a bit of a modern tone for today's audiences to understand them.The remastered picture and sound greatly improves the presentation of this miniseries. I only caught one or two scenes that had difficulties because of lighting or being inside a carriage that couldn't switch over as well, but if you are a fan of this series or of Jane Austen stories at all, you need to have this set. It explores so thoroughly the story and captures many exact lines from the book without leaving anything out.There is no doubt how much Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy made a huge impact on his career, even to the point of reprising the role somewhat as Mark Darcy in \"Bridget Jone's Diary\" based off \"Pride & Prejudice.\" Tall, dark, handsome, mysterious, and decidedly grumpy, Firth's Mr. Darcy hits all the marks for a gradual character change. First he plays Elizabeth's perception of him for about the first half and then when her view of him changes, suddenly he is a little more open and forthcoming with goodwill.Elizabeth Bennett is the most energetic and stubborn of her family and vows only to marry for love and not for money or status. Having five sisters puts their family at a disadvantage and all of her mother's attention is devoted to trying to marry them off. It is a classic story that most people are familiar with and can still emphasize with and relate to because of wonderful adaptations from the book like this one. Jennifer Ehle's performance is wonderfully proper and fiesty when she needs to be showing all the restraint and passion simultaneously that she can muster.I do enjoy the more recent version of \"Pride & Prejudice\" with Kiera Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen made 10 years after the BBC version because it speeds up some events and cuts it down to a more manageable running time of 127 minutes easier to do in one sitting compared to this version's 300 minutes. However what the 1995 version excels at is details and is more accurate to the book which die hard fans will love and find important. After all, I much prefer the \"Lord of the Rings\" extended editions of those movies because I love the story so much and adding in all those extras makes the time fly for me.My end conclusion is that this version of the story is divine for the fans out there and you should definitely pick this up for how reasonable the price is. I also recommend checking out the 2005 film of this story and 1995's \"Sense and Sensibility\" that came out soon after \"Pride and Prejudice\" that year.DVD Extras:\"Lasting Impressions\" - This feature with a running time of a full hour talks about the impact of the 1995 adaptation of \"Pride & Prejudice\" which took a modern pace and contemporary delivery to appeal to today's audience. The people interviewed for this documentary were producer Sue Birtwistle, Benjamin Whitrow who played Mr. Bennett, Alison Steadman who played Mrs. Bennett, Crispin Bonham-Carter who played Mr. Bingley, Adrian Lukis who played Wickham, and Lucy Briers who played Mary Bennett. Alison Steadman and Lucy Briers are both much more attractive women in real life! The filming of the 22 week shoot is discussed such as the order of events and how certain actors were cast. For example, the proposal scene between Darcy and Elizabeth took place VERY early and would make or break the entire story. Bingley had to learn how to ride horse and Mary barely knew how to play piano and both had to practice quite a bit. Many of the actors talk about their first scene of filming and usually it was a pretty emotional scene that they were thrown into. The actors talk about the lack of makeup people wore in those times and how Mary was just set up with some greasy hair and a bit of powder thrown across her face while her sisters were all being beautified around her. A great challenge separating the classes like the Bennett House which looks grand on its own had to pale in comparison to all the other houses in appearance. There had to be substantial differences in class in costume material and meals like giant slabs of meat. This feature is a great exploration into the making of the film and getting to hear from the supporting actors about the process, the only thing missing is Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.An impromptu walkabout with Adrian Lukis (Wickham) and Lucy Briers (Mary) is the two actors walking about the Bennett home ten years later talking about their experience. It is mostly the two of them just chatting it up on what it would have been like if their two characters had gotten together and Colin Firth supposedly calls Lukis on the phone for a few minutes. There is also a feature on the technical restoration process and what a complicated detail-driven lengthy process it is. It includes a few of those voila! moments of before and after like you see in Blu-Ray commercials to show the difference in quality.Pride & Prejudice: A Turning Point for Period Drama - Andrew Davies, the screenwriter focused on the men to get them into the story since it mostly dwells with the women. Some extra opinions that chime in agree that Colin Firth just IS Mr. Darcy in a lot of ways for a lot of people. They also praise Jennifer Ehle as a \"proper actress\" and the benefits of her performance. This feature talks more about how the script was adapted and how the costumes were created and designs. This is another lengthy feature clocking in at 31 minutes.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the final scene?", "id": "c6cef5797cbabf264f1c42b4d3d3a582", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is well-made and has an exceptional cast.  Each actor fit wonderfully with the assigned role, and even though some of the performances got a little too over the top at times (I'm referring to Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins), they still elicited a lot of chuckles.  The most inspired casting choice was Colin Firth as Darcy.  I think this is the best he's ever looked in any movie, and no one does smoldering hauteur better than he does; it gets to be that one eagerly awaits the moment when he'll next appear on the screen.There are some minor points that detracted from the movie.  The film was made to be presented on television in installments.  If one watches it all at once, rather than spaced out over time, one notices some repetitive scenes and passages of dialogue (placed in the movie not only to remain faithful to the book, but to jog the television viewer's memory over what happened in the last installment).  Also, there are some ludicrous moments where floating heads appear in mirrors or carriage windows, and again, these disembodied talking heads usually pop up to remind the viewer of something that happened earlier in the movie.  Also - and this bothered me most - I wish more of the dialogue revolved around matters that weren't strictly plot-related.  In the book there are certain comments and conversations that are omitted from the movie that I think would have fleshed out the characters more.Other than that, the BBC's Pride and Prejudice is a joy to watch.  Not only are the actors fantastic, the movie is filmed in a very picturesque way and you will love looking at the period costumes.  And Firth...

Couldn't take my eyes off it! It has everything a 12 year old kid wants in a film: action, adventure, visual splendor and even an emotional story that you can learn something from.We all know the story about two childhood friends, one Jew, the other a Roman, caught up in the turbulent times of Roman imperialism only to be split apart as adults due to their own ideology and becoming bitter enemies. The full title suggests A Tale of the Christ, which is not necesssarily true. The Christ figure serves more as metaphoric backdrop, referencing Jesus' teachings of brotherhood and it's impact on a common man, Juda Ben Hur.This is what seperates Ben Hur from most other Biblical epics. It carries a highly emotional human drama despite all the visual splendor. Lessons on humility and redemption are delivered with a sledgehammer.The film was a make-or-break gamble for MGM, who was on the verge of bankruptsy at the time due to the increasing popularity of television. No expense was spared by producer Sam Zimbalist bringing in two time Academy Award winning director William Wyler along with several writers like Gor Vidal and a $10 million dollar budget. With the odds against MGM, the film still ended up being one of the most successful films in history bringing in a record 11 Academy Awards, a record that was held for almost 40 years until Cameron's Titanic tied it.This DVD set does the film justice for many reasons. First and foremost is the restoration of the film itself. Great care was taken to bring more vibrancy to the picture quality. Previous prints had some color desaturation due to age and poor handling. The most noticable was during the famous chariot race where a tint of yellow was clearly visible on the right side of the screen. That and the usual grain and other artifacts have been eliminated bringing us the best picture this film has had since it's release. As for the sound, it's pretty much the same as the previous DVD release done in 2003, I really don't think there's much improvement that can be made given the technology at the time. But it still sounds great, especially during the crucifixation scene when the thunder really thunders giving your sub-woofer a real workout.The extras are plentiful highlighted by the inclusion of the original 1925 silent version which that in itself looks great in terms of production, storytelling and restoration of the film as well. Other extras include the previously released documentary narrated by Christopher Plummer (love his voice!) and a new documentary focusing on the impact the film made on contemporary filmmakers. We get interviews with Ridely Scott, who did the heavily Ben Hur influenced Gladiator, and good old George Lucas on the inspiration the film had on Star Wars.  Funny thing is, when I first saw The Phantom Menace, I instantly knew Georgie boy modeled the pod race after Ben's chariot race! And I was right! Other extras include some screen tests by other actors (like Detective Frank Drebin auditioning for the role of Masala!), production stills and the like.All in all, this a great package to have of one of Hollywood's most legendary classic epics. If you love action, adventure, romance and raw emotional storytelling, this is it.Blu-ray update:Take this set and frisbee it! Ben Hur Blu-ray is here at last. After years of delays for the 50th anniversary the wait has been well worth it. Warner made the right decision to say to hell with release schedules and took their sweet time putting this release together. A meticulous frame by frame restoration of the original 70mm negative done at a 6k scan has resulted in the most perfect image you going to see of this classic epic. Colors are bright and sharp as a razor, you can count the hairs and beads of sweat on Heston's arms in the chariot race.While the sound is still a bit harsh due mostly to old technology, I've found it to be more warmer sounding than before with plenty of boom.Aside from the same extras you get on the DVD package, you also get a new HD documentary that focuses on Heston's experiences while filming Ben Hur complete with home movie footage behind the scenes. You also get a pictorial book and a reproduction of Heston's personal diary that's quite informative.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the picture?", "id": "283eefa1babff75a20d41a4478104649", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "6304045425", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Cool Cool...i really enjoyed this fine feature film.

For that's what happens to poor John as one Dr.Noymann in a radiation accident.After his funeral he rises from the dead and visits a friend Dr.Penner,played by another veteran actor Philip Tonge(the department store manager in Miracle on 34th Street).Penner is told by his old friend that he is indeed dead but his body is inhabited by a creature from outer space who,along with many others already there,plan to take over the world.He is given the opportunity to warn the worlds' powers but no one believes him.Eventually the aliens are forced to take drastic action which awakens the world to their presence.Dr.Penner,his daughter,her boyfriend and an air force Major Jay(John Agar) take refuge in a mountain hideout to come up with a solution,as the world is at the brink of destruction at the hands of the alien controlled undead.The solution arrived at is a sound ray that forces the entities to leave the host bodies and then die.Earth one,aliens nothing.Carradine and Tonge bring their combined acting experiences together which helps an otherwise tepid movie.Because of them the movie at times can appear better than it is.It does move along relatively well and it is a decent little time waster.Unlike the flip side movie here,Journey to the Seventh Planet.Journey puts the \"bad\" into the B-movie.It concerns a journey to Uranus(the 7th planet).While the credits roll the rocket ship is passing Jupiter,then Saturn.Come the opening scenes of the film,we see Mars and the captain asks their location.The response is that they just passed the moon and they should be coming up on Mars! Maybe they liked Uranus so much this movie is about their second journey(?).No matter,just before they land an alien energy/mind force freezes the crew ,explaining it has plans to take over their minds and bodies and destroy them.They land on the planet and discover a breathable atmosphere and the landscape is forested.Upon further exploration they discover they are in a protective force barrier outside of which is the real atmosphere of the planet.They also discover that the creature is making many of their thoughts and desires come true,and where male astronauts are involved there has to be some females to amuse them,which dutfiully appear along the way.Outside the barrier they finally discover the creatures'lair and they hurt it enough to escape in their space ship.A real head scratching moment comes(and there are many!)as they board to leave.Outside is waiting one of the captain's \"mirage\" women and for some reason he takes her aboard.All along he has been warning the others to keep their distance,that they aren't real and should be avoided;yet he does that!?? Well just after take off the \"mirage\" lady becomes just that and disappears before the crew as background music swells up as that chart topping tune of the day \"Journey to the 7th Planet\"plays.Who'd have guessed? This plot is SO weak,the acting so stilted and the aliens so mundane that you wish this MOVIE had gone to Uranus and stayed for the duration.John Agar from Invisible Invaders also plays in this stinker too and adds to the dullness from begining to merciful end.Both films are in remarkable shape technically speaking,however.Invaders is in B&W; (full screen) and Journey is in colour in a nice widescreen format.Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp.Unfortunately this can't extricate this release from its' two star fate.Invaders is the most appealing of the two with Journey falling far,far behind.I can only see this having appeal to the most compleatist of Sci-Fi fans out there or those who have a tinge of nostalgia for one or both of these flatulant flicks!", "qas": [{"question": "Where can I print a movie?", "id": "912fd7c39f26a57702402fe16c6b229b", "answers": [{"text": "Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp", "answer_start": 3630}, {"text": "This is another in the \"Midnite Movies\" releases", "answer_start": 0}]}]}]}, {"title": "6304083769", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This movie is set in the not to distant future, it is about a police officer who happens to be an android.

However, simply recreating the oppressive atmosphere and dread of the original would likely have been near impossible and a bit redundant even if he had succeeded, so it's good that he moved it in a new direction.  Fortunately, despite the many differences, NotLD and DotD are similarly excellent.Although they are very different, the basic plots to the first 2 films of Romero's trilogy are more or less the same: there's a zombie apocalypse, which forces small group of survivors to hideout in and barricade a building in hopes of simply waiting it out.  Now, however, the small farmhouse is replaced with a huge mall, and we are given an even smaller group of 4 survivors.  Overall the acting is pretty good, especially considering the budget it had.  The characters are generally fairly appealing, so long as they are intended to be, and they have a realistic ordinariness to them, much like they did in NotLD.  Despite the emphasis on violence and action through out the film they're some fairly powerful scenes just between the main characters.  There's a great scene of them hanging out in their nicely furnished apartment, listening to some sad Spanish/classical sounding guitar while they kill time by gambling with their worthless money.  It gives a great sense of desolation.  There's also an even somewhat touching scene involving the one character visiting someone's grave.(In fact, I think pretty much all the scenes involving that characters death are very effective, though I won't go into that so as not to give too much away.)  It's effective, as are pretty much all the best conventionally dramatic scenes in the film, because it's so simple and un-theatrical.In my review of NotLD I urged new viewers to discard their expectations form modern horror films.  This is perhaps even more necessary for Dawn of the Dead.  Frankly, it mainly classifies as a horror film out of convenience, as it blends and shifts from horror to action to adventure to satire to straight drama.(It's rather reminiscent of the much newer and equally excellent 28 Days Later in this way.)  As for the classic complaint to all horror films, \"It's not scary.\" well, this one isn't even trying to be scary, for the most part. (And if you doubt this assertion, just listen to the commentary.  Romero pretty much says this is the case.) Still, it does have a few remarkably powerful and eerie scenes.  The raid on the projects is genuinely horrific, (if not scary in the conventional sense), particularly the slow extermination of the zombies in the basement.  There are some good scenes in the mall too, particularly when the guys go off to clear it out, and one zombie just stares at Fran through the glass and later, when the mall has been cleared out, but they all still hear the zombies rubbing and scratching against the glass, trying to get in.  These scenes are particularly effective as they come towards the middle, where it becomes more action/adventure/satire oriented, so they provide good contrast.Much is made of the violence in this film,(done by gore legend Tom Savini) and not without good reason.  Despite the fact that it was released about 25 years ago, the sheer volume of gore shown in this film outdoes anything I've seen released by a major studio up to this day.(Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the only one that comes close that I've seen) Admittedly most of it is fairly dated, largely because of the blood (which is too orange and the texture doesn't seem right) but it still has a pretty strong impact a lot of the time.  There are something like 70 graphically portrayed gunshot wounds in the film along with plenty of melee violence and the requisite cannibalism.  The scenes of flesh eating are always pretty gross, particularly the zombie-man taking chunks out of his still living wife and the montage of mutilation and gut-eating towards the end.  It's also got a very nice and very sudden shotgun-induced head explosion. (If you really want gore, though, you need to check out the sequel, Day of the Dead. Actually, you should check that out either way)Obviously, if you are disturbed or offended by graphic violence you oughta pass this up, though you probably already knew that.Much is made of the satire in humor in this film, and while it is pretty effective, it isn't the emphasis of the film the some people would like to pretend it is.  That is to say, the film isn't simply a vehicle for Romero's thoughts on modern society and consumerism and whatnot.  That element certainly is there, but as a whole he mostly wanted to make an enjoyable film. (Once again, if you doubt this listen to Romero in the commentary.) Still, the satire is very important in that it provides a great contrast to the other elements of the picture.  This matters because these bizarre tone changes are one of the main things that make the film so good.There seem to be some conflicting opinions about the conclusion where the film kinda tears apart, with an invasion of weird bikers and particularly graphic violence mixed with some odd physical comedy.  Personally, I think it works, and the humor and violence aren't just mixed randomly; it starts out more weird and lighthearted and steadily becomes more dark and gruesome.This is a pretty bare-bones DVD, but it looks and sounds excellent.  Apparently there's gonna be a special addition later this year with a different cut (which is NOT a directors cut, by the way, just an earlier, formative one.) as well, and it'll presumably have more extra features.  So if you care about that sort of stuff you oughta hold off til then.(I think it's coming out in October.)  If you haven't seen it, check this version out.", "qas": [{"question": "How is film?", "id": "3e192a138f3c3c9653206215eb1433bb", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "When Anchor Bay announced they were comming out with a Dawn of the Dead \"ultimate Edition\" they really meant it. You can see really see the blood sweat and tears that went through this dvd by looking at the cover. This review will mostly refer to the dvd, i don't have to explain what a cult classic this horror movie is. This is deff. the landmark of all zombie flicks. you zombie fans know that!! Enough said, the moment I popped in the first disc i was blown away by the transfer. The Dts. 5.1 surround sound really gives the movie a great boost. From every zombie moan to every bullet being fired, my speakers turn my room into a mall! (Slight exaggeration) There is very little grain even the night shots are pretty decent. As for the second disc (directors cut), which iv been waiting for years to see is simply amazing. Although the director's cut is only a 2.0 surround sound it still is stunning to see the 139 minute master piece. The special features on the first and second disc are weak but hey thats what the BONUS DISC is for right? On the director's cut there are some actual commericials from the Monroeville mall in the late 70's in case your interested. The commentary is pretty solid too, with DVD producers Richard P. Rubinstein and Perry Martin. I personlly like the commentary on the first disc with Make up master Tom Savini and the King of horror himself George A. Romero. You also get a comic book preview. Now for disc three, (European version) You get the cast commentary with Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross. The sound presented in this European version has good quality, 5.1 surround sound, 2.0 dolby surround, or the simple original mono. Picture wise, the transfer is decent. The special features are good too, you get all the international tv. spots, trailers, artwork, ect. You get the idea... Now for disc four, The Dead will walk Documentary is quite stunning, you get amazing interviews with just about everyone involved on the set of Dawn of the dead, on top of that you get the original documentary, you also get to look at home movies from zombie extra Robert Langer, the best part on the 4th disc is deff. the Monroeville Mall tour by the big man himself Ken Foree, Ken Foree makes the tour entertaining and keeps it brief. The packaging is amazing as well, you get an actual Dawn of the dead Comic book along with a good solid insert on all 4 discs. Overall one of the best movies and dvd packages of all time from Anchor Bay.

For me, it harkens back to the old black & white \"African Safari\" films of the 30's and 40's, but with better acting, story and realism.I love wildlife, so I could never watch a movie where wild animals are killed by hunters just out for something to take back home and stuff! This story isn't about that, its about human survival against two predators who were known to have killed 135 human rail-workers just for the pleasure (we know that Lions will kill baboons just because they hate baboons, so to me, this is believable) of it in 1898.I think Val Kilmer is one of the most underrated actors of his generation. He does a great job portraying a real life Victorian era Irish engineer, John Henry Patterson, believable brogue and all, and creates a character you like and can relate to. Even Michael Douglas' self-indulgent creation of the fictional character \"Charles Remington\", whom Douglas created for himself (Douglas was also Executive Producer on the film) is a great addition to the story and is well portrayed by Douglas. The friendship that develops between Patterson (Kilmer) and Remington (Douglas) is believable and when Remington becomes the lions next victim, he is truly missed. The supporting cast is wonderful, even if many of them don't survive to the films climactic end.One of the standout elements of The Ghost and the Darkness was the score composed for it by, the now late, Jerry Goldsmith. Jerry Goldsmith always had a penchant for scoring for African/Desert themed films and this score is no exception. It is powerful, moving, frightening and lends the exact right flavor to the film and compliments its visuals perfectly. I usually don't get too weepy when watching films, but when Goldsmith plays his sweet, sweeping \"resolution\" theme when Patterson sees his wife at the Tsavo train station and meets his newborn son for the first time at the conclusion of the film, I can't help but get choked up by the scene! The scene of Patterson's burning of the fields after Remington is killed is powerfully accentuated by Goldsmith's music!As mentioned in the film, the two actual male Lions who were the man-eaters in the real event are on display at the Field Museum in Chicago. I have visited the museum and saw the two lions myself. Although the lions are maneless, which is a trait of Tsavo lions (they were portrayed in the film as HAVING manes), they are HUGE and one can see the power and ferocity that was there once.The film itself is HIGHLY underrated and tends to get maligned, mostly by people who admit that they never actually sat down and watched the film from beginning to end. I think this low opinion of the film is completely unjustified, because, even IF you don't like the film's subject matter, this incident REALLY occurred, the acting is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, the locations are great, the music is magnificent and the story is gripping and moving.Technically, the DVD is not the best quality transfer that it could have been and I hope they re-release it on DVD and Blu-Ray someday soon with a higher resolution transfer. The Ghost and the Darkness DESERVES to be seen in its best form!I give \"The Ghost and The Darkness\" 5 stars without hesitation.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the soundtrack?", "id": "58622a36079b4dd0bb001e75564495a9", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "6304457324", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This review is for the DVD version of \"Jeremiah Johnson\" released October 30, 2007.November 3, 2013:  I have just finished viewing the Blu-ray version and it is by far the best version I have seen.  Hence, I strongly recommend that you purchase the Blu-ray version if you have a player.Have you ever dreamed of living in the wilderness, on your own, or being a mountain man? If so, \"Jeremiah Johnson\" is the movie for you; if not, the film just may change your mind. I was going to the University of Utah when \"Jeremiah Johnson\" was filmed, and was easily lured into reading \"Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson\" by Raymond W. Thorp and Robert Bunker (1958), and \"Mountain Man\" by Vardis Fisher (1965). Being a history major and researcher by nature, I did not stop there. I read many journal and newspaper articles, and a few rare documents that mentioned the man I learned was born in New Jersey with the name John Garrison. As much as I love Utah, I was dismayed by the fact that the real John Johnston spent most of his life in Montana, and as a resident of Montana (and someone who has lived in places where Johnston lived), I can assure you that the geography is very different. In particular, the Lolo and Flathead Valleys where the Flathead Indians lived are lush, rich, productive lands--not barren rocks and bushes as depicted in the movie. None-the-less, I went to see \"Jeremiah Johnson\" with an open mind--and loved the movie. Why? Because in the final analysis, \"Jeremiah Johnson\" has little to nothing to do with the historical figure the movie is allegedly based upon.With this fact in mind, I suggest that you look at the Wikipedia listing and [...] for more \"factual\" information about the historical John Johnston. I will address the main character of the film, the fictional Jeremiah Johnson, and the \"historical\" attributes portrayed in the film. As for the books, I can only say this: \"Mountain Man\" is a beautifully romantic fictional story, but there are better non-fiction books available. \"Crow-Killer\" is a comical read for anyone who knows a thing about mountain men, but is otherwise a farce.In 1979, seven years after \"Jeremiah Johnson\" was released, I met John Arlee, the Native American technical adviser for the show, and an uncredited actor who played the role of the Flathead Indian that did the translating. When I met John, he was presiding over a ceremony as a Flathead medicine man. Since then, John, who is fluent in the Flathead dialect of the Salish language, has gone on to author several (educational) books and teach Salish at the Salish-Kutenai College in Pablo, Montana. His stories--which are not mine to share--about making the movie are gems, and would make a great read themselves. But John was quite proud of his part in the film, and the accuracy he brought to it concerning Flathead culture (all be it, some 10-12 hours south of where it should have been filmed). Having done little study of the Flathead or any Salish speaking group prior to working with John, I was very pleased to learn that Flathead Indian scenes of the \"Jeremiah Johnson\" were done as well as can be expected for a big budget film.As time has passed, and I have learned more, I have come to appreciate the realities of the 20 year vendetta with the \"Crow\" Indians portrayed in \"Jeremiah Johnson.\" [Please note that I am using the more familiar term used to refer to this nation of people, rather than their own word, \"Aps&aacute;alooke\"]. First and foremost, one must understand that the Crows have a matriarchal clan family social structure. As with many societies that have clan structures, offenses and accolades towards any clan member are made to the clan head. While I have found no definitive evidence that Johnston or any of the Crow clans had a vendetta with each other, there are \"stories\" (with limited depth) that there was some sort of \"disagreement\" between Johnston and one of the (Mountain) Crow clans. If such were the case, it would have played out as depicted in \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" with individual Crow members seeking retribution for Johnson's act of killing the \"war\" party that killed his wife. For the Crow, there would be no logical connection between their having killed Johnson's wife (and the fictitious boy in the movie) and Johnson's killing of those men. When the Crows killed Johnson's wife, they were killing an enemy--an act of \"war\"; when Johnson kills the Crows--from the Crow perspective--Johnson is committing murder, not war. Thus Johnson started a \"feud\" with the clan(s) of those he killed.While the language in the film may be objectionable to some, I feel that it is used sparingly and is appropriate to the attitude of the film; just as the jargon of the mountain men is used minimally, but effectively. And while I have had no experience with re-inactors of mountain men, my sense is that what little information is shown in the film (e.g., using coals to keep warm at night) are well, if not accurately, portrayed. One must remember that mountain men were for the most part people that did not give two hoots about anybody--including themselves--and lived life as they saw fit. Their customs and mannerisms were their own; everyone else be damned. And, most mountain men, contrary to what many may be believe, shared little with the \"fur trappers\" and explorers of the times; let alone the \"settlers.\" Most mountain men, in fact, preferred Native Americans and their way of life, which lead to their inclusion of being labeled with the pejorative, demeaning, and insulting phrase \"squaw men.\" [\"Squaw\" has a very poor etiology, with most non-Native Americans believing that it is a prototype word that was \"common\" to most Indian tribes for woman, while many others use the Iroquois definition: vagina (or, more correctly, an obscene reference to vagina). Hence, \"squaw man\" would really mean \"a man who likes vagina.\"]In the movie, Jeremiah Johnson is clearly a loner--and he likes it that way. Yes, he spends time trading with various Indians, but he has learned a lesson the hard way: when he helped the \"low landers\" find the missing wagons (I could never figure out why they knew where they were but could not get back there) his actions led him to commit fatal mistakes. First he left his wife (and the boy) alone, then he led the \"search party\" through sacred ground, which he himself believed was VERY wrong, and then he vented his self anger at the closest group of people he could find. Please note that the movie never makes it clear that the party of Crows he kills are the same people that killed his wife! All of these actions were contrary to those of a typical mountain man; of course building the cabin was too.But in the final analysis, \"Jeremiah Johnson\" is just too good of a movie to really complain about--especially if one gets over the fact that it really has nothing to do with the historical figure, John Johnston, other than the film makers make reference to the two books as \"source material.\" I would argue that the fact that in the end the movie was called \"Jeremiah Johnson\" and not \"Liver-Eaten Johnson\" is evidence that the film makers wanted to make a romantic film about mountain men, not a story of one man. If you have not seen \"Jeremiah Johnson\" you are missing one of the greatest movies ever made. It is tremendously engrossing and entertaining; but I would not recommend it for children. If you like the outdoors, \"Jeremiah Johnson\" will have you dreaming of your next outing.For those of you wanting the \"real\" dirt--what is the difference between this version and the \"cheaper\" version--it is the casing that the DVD comes in! The cheap one is in the older cardboard type box, this one is in a hard plastic box. Unfortunately, the disc is still double sided (full and wide screen versions), and the \"bonus\" features are the same. (Yes, I have both versions.) More important to me is that any hopes of a \"directors\" cut seem to have been lost, since Sydney Pollack has recently passed away. The fake intro and intermission--that were not part of any of the theatrical showings I attended--had given me some hope that there might be some additional scenes, but that was not the case. I am not even sure that I can truly tell the difference between the DVD and VHS versions I have, other than the tape is getting old.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

Being a true take on the then new Dark Knight series of comics that treated its readers to a more mature and brooding Batman, giving them strong, well thought out stories with a more adult theme.  This was (in my opinion) due to the influence of the up and coming Manga trend surfacing in the west with the hugely popular Akira film.  Burton and Keaton created, on the screen, a Dark hero for the 90's that the fans of the comics could relate to and it worked BIG time marrying stark visuals with a music score as rich as you could fit on any film. For a home cinema owner there is little better out there to show off your systems capability than with than this film.  As with most sequels the second, Batman Returns, was less than the original, in this case suffering from too many characters/stars all demanding a piece of the screen time, why on earth the studios think that more is better is beyond me. Quality is ALWAYS better than quantity in a film as born out in many sequels vs. originals. That is not to say that this was a poor film, far from it, just not as good as the first. There were too many character origins to make the main plot anything other than passable.  Now, onto the third in the series. A new director will always bring with them a new vision of a character and story and Schumacher is no different, I believe another reviewer had the same thoughts as me on this one 'The Dark Knight in Technicolor'. For fans of the first two films this had to be a bit of a shock, new Batman and a real glossy comic book feel to the film. This was good escapism but lacked the mature approach of the first two films.  Oh dear, with the final outing, Batman Forever, we see where Schumacher got his inspiration, not from the comics, not from the first films, oh no, anyone remember the campy, hammy Batman TV series with Burt Ward I believe?? Yup the only thing missing from this film were tights and the visual sound affects. POW BASH KA-BLAMMY.  I strongly feel that the stars were wasted on this film, which is a great pity as there is far more potential to this series than has been shown thus far.  In summery, the first two films are ideal teen upward viewing, the second two are in my opinion squarely aimed at kids.

When it was over, I was scared s***less the whole summer break.  Oddly enough, I kept watching the movie throughout the summer, despite the fact that it was the most terrifying movie I've ever seen (and remains so to this day).  I remember everyday from that summer, constantly fearing that a deranged Dr. Weir would break into my room and ritualistically end my existence.  Even worse, I vividly remember my brother reenacting the infamous \"video transmission\" scene by holding golf balls covered in fake blood (to look like eyeballs) and covered himself with fake blood as he was saying \"Liberate tutame ex inferis.\"  Summer break eventually ended and with school starting up, I was finally able to dispose any memories I had of the movie.  Sam Neill advertised for MCI at the time and even though I knew it wasn't really Dr. Weir, I still freaked out at the sight of those commercials.  I would stay away from this movie for about seven years.  In March of 2005, me and my friends held a \"movie night\" at my best friend's place over the weekend and I quickly saw Event Horizon on the video store shelf and I told my friends \"You want to see a really messed up movie?  Watch this.\"  We rented Event Horizon and all of the deliciously evil and terrifying memories flooded back to my head that night; I couldn't sleep for days.PLOT:For those of you new to Event Horizon, here's the lowdown.  In the year 2040, a space ship called the Event Horizon was launched to reach Proxima Centauri (Earth's nearest star) by using an artificial dimensional gateway to create a black hole, bridging the two points in space to drastically reduce journey time.  When the ship goes about on its mission, it disappears without a trace.  It's currently 2047 and the Event Horizon has returned off the orbit of Neptune.  The Lewis and Clark rescue shuttle is dispatched to investigate and salvage the ship.  As the Lewis and Clark docks with the Event Horizon and the rescue crew probes the ship, things start to go awry.SETTING:To me, this is the perfectly executed sci-fi/horror hybrid movie.  Why?  Event Horizon has many things going for it, but one of the best aspects is the perfect setting.  Think about it; not only does the Event Horizon have a creepy gothic interior, the ship itself is surrounded by stormy conditions in space, you're stranded because your boarding ship was heavily damaged, the Event Horizon's communication functions are shot (not able to contact for help), and the only transmission you have of the ship's original crew truly sounds like screams out of hell.  If you were aboard the Event Horizon, wouldn't you be scared?  I sure would!!CHARACTERS:The actors do an excellent job with their roles; particularly Lawrence Fishburne as Captain Miller, Sam Neill as Dr. Weir, Kathleen Quinlan as Lt. Peters, and Jason Isaacs as D.J.  To me, Dr. Weir is one of the best and most evil villains I've ever seen in film; so much so, I had to namedrop him on my review of Morbid Angel's \"Altars of Madness\" to describe how evil that album is.  Dr. Weir isn't some one-dimensional character that's evil and nothing else; he was originally a man of scientific ambition with his Event Horizon project but his work would cause his wife, Claire, to commit suicide from loneliness.  This would haunt Weir and when he boards his long lost creation, it would mentally torment him with his sins and drive him into a state of evil madness.  Even prior to Weir's transformation as the antagonist, you can tell there was something messed up about him when he's aboard the Lewis and Clark, playing an intercepted transmission from the Event Horizon with a straight face, despite it sounding so hellish.  Lt. Peters and Captain Miller also have interesting back stories involving Peters having to abandon her crippled son and Miller having to abandon one of his crew members on a burning space ship several years prior.  Along with Weir's sins, the Event Horizon would use the sins of Miller and Peters to torment them.  Rescue tech Cooper (Richard T. Jones) does a good job at providing a little humor in the movie to keep the audience from spiraling into states of madness; I particularly like him telling X.O. Starck as he was giving crew members coffee \"Want something hot and black inside you?\"SCARE TACTICS AND OTHER NASTY STUFF:Unlike most horror movies that use clich&eacute; settings and scare tactics to unnerve the audience, this uses much more original ideas to scare movie fans.  In Event Horizon, there's no boogeyman, no hideous aliens, and not even any physical life forms on it!!  The thing that makes this movie so scary is that it perfectly utilizes the whole \"fear of the unknown\" concept as no one investigating the ship knows what they're dealing with.  Paul Anderson's interpretation of hell is also more original, making it more unnerving.  The clich&eacute; fire and brimstone imagery has been replaced with the ship's gravity drive deck filled with some of the most horrendous looking corpses ever put on film.  This brings me to my next point.  There's lots of gore in this movie, but unlike mediocre flicks like Hostel and The Hills Have Eyes, the gore in this movie is used to enhance the dark, unnerving atmosphere of the movie rather than relying solely on it.  In other words, the violence in this movie won't bore you.  The violence in this movie REALLY is disturbing; the scene where Starck and Peters unscramble the video in the ship's computer showing the original crew killing and eating each other still freaks me out to this day.  The scene where Dr. Weir attacks D.J. on the medical deck is really appalling as you can see Dr. Weir's bloody, empty eye sockets and the way he kills D.J. is guaranteed to freak out movie goers.  As Weir and Miller duke it out toward the end, Weir forces Miller to see Hell and trust me, it really is terrifying.THEMES AND ESOTERIC THINGS:Religion is a big theme in Event Horizon, as you can already tell with the constant mention of Hell and the use of Latin in some scenes.  The concept of creating artifical black holes to reduce time in space travel is really neat; I just hope I'm dead before technology advances that far!!  Something that I really enjoyed was when D.J.'s carcass is shown in the medical deck, there's lots of esoteric occult symbols painted everywhere.  I'm really glad that Anderson didn't use something typical like the pentagram and inverted cross to represent Hell, and the mysterious nature of these creepy symbols adds to the terror in this movie.  These symbols would also appear on Dr. Weir's body when he comes back as some sort of undead creature towards the end of the movie.  Everything in Event Horizon isn't tied up in a neat little bow, there's several little things that aren't fully explained.  I normally don't like it when movies do this as it usually comes off as laziness, but it works for Event Horizon because they do it in a manner that satisfies the viewer at the end of the movie but makes them wonder about other things.  For one, you never really see the \"chaos dimension,\" only images of people getting horribly killed aboard the Event Horizon.  So that leaves your imagination to decide what this dimension really looks like.SOUNDTRACK:For the most part, the soundtrack is magnificent; it perfectly fuses hard techno beats with chilling classical orchestra melodies.  The weird combination perfectly suits the movie.  The only music track I hated was the one at the very end by The Prodigies called \"Funky S***,\" it sounds bad and fits nowhere in the movie, even though it was only on the credits.EXTRAS:The current edition of Event Horizon has a second disk full of bonus features.  While these features aren't as abundant as say those in the T2:  Extreme Edition DVD set, they are worthwhile.  There's featurettes about the making of Event Horizon along with videos of concept art.  While I liked the conceptual drawings and 3D renderings provided in the DVD set, they could have added more and I would have preferred that each image was presented as a still frame rather than a video montage with commentary because with DVD programs like Cyberlink Power DVD that include \"snapshot\" features, I like to make \"snapshots\" of these art pieces so that I can quickly get ideas when I hit the drawing boards for my own creations.  Still, I enjoyed what I got in this area.  The \"making of\" featurettes are a real treat, they show the numerous difficulties filming the movie and the neat props and filming techniques used to make this film possible.  After watching these, I wasn't too pleased at Paramount for terribly rushing Paul Anderson and his crew to finish Event Horizon at a certain deadline.  These corporate slimeballs would also force Anderson to cut out about 40 minutes of the original edition of the movie because test audiences were too freaked out by the level of violence in it.  Some scenes were put on the bonus disk, and while pretty satisfying to see, it's a shame that they couldn't be restored into the film itself.  However, given that Event Horizon came out before the DVD revolution and that Paramount wasn't too pleased by the film's poor performance in the box office, the uncut editions of the movie have been lost.  Infact, Anderson stated he had to go all over the world to find the lost footage included on the DVD.  In short, I can't blame Anderson for this shortcoming as the blame really belongs to Paramount for their unrealistic time demands and the wimpy test audiences for their squeamishness.  All in all, the bonus disk is a nice addition to the movie.CRITICISM:The only bad thing I can say about Event Horizon was the song played at the end credits, which I already stated under \"soundtracks.\"  This is only noticeable flaw that I could find in this movie, but it doesn't really detract the quality of the film as a whole.  Apparently, a lot of people panned this movie for being too violent and scary.  That's mind-bogglingly stupid; panning an R-rated sci-fi/horror movie for being scary and violent is like panning The Ren and Stimpy Show or The Simpsons for making people laugh.  For the people who didn't like the movie for these aspects, what were you expecting this to be?  A family film about Shaqulle O' Neal in space rapping and playing basketball with aliens?  Do your homework next time, there's ratings and content descriptions on the movie posters and DVD cases, READ THEM!!FINAL WORD:In Paul Anderson's filmography, Event Horizon is easily his crowning jewel.  It's really sad that he'd sink to such low levels in making such junk like Alien vs Predator and Resident Evil.  Event Horizon isn't a movie for everyone, but if you want a movie that will give you nightmares and weird things to discuss with fellow cinema buffs, Event Horizon will reward you greatly.", "qas": [{"question": "Does the costume design great?", "id": "1f6350d2be8a50d6e7422eecfdafb6c2", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "6304819927", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Okay, let's be brief: If you didn't grow up in the horror lovin' 80's or are not an established fan of Italian horror films, this movie probably won't work for you. This is the unofficial sequel to Romero's \"Dawn Of The Dead\" (the 1978 version of course) made primary for Italian audiences when Dawn was released there under the title of \"Zombi\". Even though this one doesn't take place in a mall or feature anything or anyone like the original storyline of Dawn, it does have almost the same feel. Eventually in America, this film came to us with English dubbed audio under the title of \"Zombie\". But now Shriek Show has finally released a remastered 2 disc set of this classic movie fully uncut for the first time in the states.Or so I thought.Ya see, when the movie starts, there's a brief scene set-up (as it always was), then it goes into the opening credits. I was expecting to see the original Italian credits showing it finally under it's original title \"Zombi 2\", like the box. But it isn't, it's the American version with the title \"Zombie\". Nitpicking, huh? But after a little searching I found an Easter Egg that shows that original title sequence that finally shows that this film was called \"Zombi 2\". Here's how to get to it (it's easy....):On Disc One go to the \"Features\" section. In there, press the number \"6\" on your remote. It will activate a red skull button in the upper right on the screen (you CAN'T activate it by searching around the menu with your arrow buttons, very rare by Easter Egg standards!), and it will press the button automatically and take you to the original Italian opening credits and clearly show that this film was called \"Zombi 2\", logo and all. Also, after they're done, it will show an alternate end credits, but honestly I couldn't see any difference on them as opposed to the ones on the movie now.All in all, this movie has never looked or sounded better ever. Some say it's looks too cleaned up now. They might have a point because the picture is so perfect now (colors bright, sharp image, brightness exact, sound crisp, etc) that it gives away the effects in the movie. Well, I'd rather have this movie perfect picture than a dark, grainy VHS anyday.This movie is a classic piece of horror history and should be owned (especially the Shriek Show 25th Anniversary version...the extras here are superior....the making of documentary is as long as the movie itself!) by anyone with two or more \"Living Dead/Zombie\" DVD's already in their collection. I'm glad I got it, THIS is the way classic horror should be re-released.P.S.: If you look hard enough (the DVD's trailer section has their previews), there is a \"Zombi 3\" and a \"Zombie 4\" movies out there too. Trust me, you don't need them or want them, as they don't have the same feel or quality of \"Zombi 2\" or \"Dawn Of The Dead\". Just be happy with their trailers.

Contact is lost with the control facility and what is discovered is that a race of aliens has taken control of the giant monsters. The giant monsters are sent to many different cities across the world and the human race must then wrestle control of the giant monsters back from the aliens. Fun stuff!Video:I'm torn here. I really, really wanted to love this release. What is there is 1080p HD in name, but the detail quality seems kind of low. I don't know what happened, but the colors seem washed out and faded while there are some instances of dust and dirt to be seen. Interestingly enough, you can still see the control cables and wires used for various special effects, so perhaps this was the best that could be done with it? I've read (and a commenter stated the possibility) that the source was a 35mm print.In my mind, the Blu Ray doesn't look to be much better than an upscaled DVD. I don't have the Media Blasters DVD to compare directly, so I don't know if it really is an upscale or not, but every indication points to this being a true HD source.Disappointing from an HD perspective certainly. If this is the same quality that was released in Japan (can't verify myself, sorry), then that tells me it is a source issue, but I don't know because I can't compare.Forums I've been to indicate this is the same master used on the Japanese release, but take that for what it is worth without validation.Audio:5.1 Japanese, along with 2.0 Japanese and English 2.0 (2 audio streams for English). I watched in Japanese 5.1 and the music and effects seem to be well separated in the front speakers, while the rear channels barely got much use. Since this was original recorded in 2.0 stereo anyway, I flipped over and I have to say the stereo separation is just about as good in my mind as the 5.1 in Japanese.I spot checked the English audio tracks and they seem to be on par in terms of audio quality as the Japanese. In terms of the quality of the English dub, I leave that to others to decide. Seems OK to me, but I expect hokey English on my giant monster movies anyway!Based on a comment on my review, I went back to check the English dub. I can confirm, without question, that BOTH the AIP AND the \"International\" Toho dub are, in fact, on this disc. Both English tracks are, however, in 2.0 Stereo ONLY. There is no 5.1 English dub. Not that most people who wanted the AIP dub would care that much, considering the film was in 2.0 stereo originally anyway.Packaging:For those of you in love with the image Amazon has up, be prepared to be disappointed. Or not, if you hated it. From the time it was displayed here to time of release, the cover has been changed. If you check out the Destroy All Monsters wikipedia entry, this release uses the poster artwork displayed there. It looks good to me.Otherwise the packaging is pretty bare bones. No inserts in the case or anything. Serviceable, but at $30 MSRP I'd have hoped for something a little better.Extras:Commentary is pretty good. Very nice to have it included.All of the trailers are in standard definition, which is OK I suppose.All of the Extras content is 480i and NOT 1080p.You get original trailers (English, Japanese, French (poor audio quality), RADIO spots for the AIP dub (English only with still images from the film) ), a storyboard image gallery, an 8mm reel from AIP (quality is poor, but it's still really cool to see this!) and image gallery.In my original Amazon review I ended up passing over a lot of the extras, so for that, I am terribly sorry.The extras on this disc are pretty fantastic in my mind. Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock put a lot of love into pulling together all of this material.Final Verdict:Destroy All Monsters is one of the best Godzilla movies around. It deserves to be owned, certainly. The Blu Ray release is probably the prettiest release the movie has seen, though that's not saying much with some of the previous releases.I've given it 4 stars because of the sloppy video (possibly not Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock's fault, I don't know). What is outstanding is the audio. Video drops the review by a star.If you don't already own it and enjoy the film, this is definitely worth picking up. If you are OK with the video quality on prior release and don't care about the AIP dub, keep your money.If you want the AIP English dub, this is THE release to get.Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock did an outstanding job on this release. Pulling together the trailers, the radio spots and even the commentary shows me that they actually appreciate the release as much as many fans. The video quality is the only mar on an outstanding release and it is something I can look past, as I've since learned that the video is from Toho's own remastered (in 2008) video.If you are a Godzilla fan, this is definitely worth the purchase price without question.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the video good?", "id": "8d43edbfe903072105627d6dadd49e61", "answers": [{"text": "the detail quality seems kind of low", "answer_start": 914}, {"text": "sloppy video", "answer_start": 4476}]}]}]}, {"title": "6304983794", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In 1985, George A. Romero released the third enstallment in his Zombie trilogy entitled Day of the Dead. The film starring Joe Pilato, Lori Cadelle, Jaralath Conroy, and Terry Alexander is actually a quite effective  apocalyptic continuation of the grim circumstances exisitng in Romero's  previous Dawn of the Dead. The drastically increasing population of the  living dead has reached such a critical point that they might wipe out  humanity completely. The social and psychological allusions Romero made in  the two previous movies are now omniously coming true. Instead of humans  fighting along side one another against the zombie threat, the human  inclination to question authority, bicker over petty details, and become  obsessed with only self-preservation has lead to the fatal dis-unity of the  human race.  These dire cirumstances allow Romero's zombie ranks to grow  and grow and grow. With such a grim obstacle facing mankind, Romero starts  his story by showing a large metropolitian landscape devoid of all life  except for thousands and thousands of the living dead. As Day's story  progresses, Romero begins authoring his most intense critique of modern  society yet. Romero is known for his ability to work in culture and society  issues deep within the subtext of his work. The lack of unity and  submission to fear in Night or the comparison of mall shoppers to the  living dead in Dawn are great examples of his directorial style. In all  three of the Dead films, the decades the films were composed in were  portrayed fairly well within the macabre boundaries of Romero's grisly  canvas. Each film captured the genesis of it's personality from the decade  it was birthed in. The paranoia and fear of world decimation of the 60's,  the jubliant pro-violent self preservation of the 70's, and the birth of  yuppie ignorant conservatism of the 80's. Tom Savini again supplies us with  utterly unbelevable zombie special effects. The zombies now have a  de-compossed look suggesting that  quite a bit of time has passed between  Night and Day of the Dead. Beyond all of the societal commentary and  analysis, Day remains the least engaging of the Dead films. Due to the  tremendous lack of funds needed to film Romero's orginal Day of the Dead  script (estimated to have costed 10 million dollars), Romero had to  severely tone done his story and foucs on 80's society. The result is a  haphazard film with a compelling story, touches of brillance, and virtuoso  grisly special effects. However,the film lacks any new focus to necessitate  more zombie gore. Not to mention the characters are so one-dimensional and  unpleasant that the audience can't care for Romero's characters with the  same passion they had in the past. With such lofty expectations produced  from the previous two classics, Romero was unable to explore any new  philosophical ground with his zombies. Only the inclusion on  &quot;Bub&quot; adds anything to the whole of the landscape of Romero's  Zombie-filled world. The results lead to so-so conclusion to Romero's  Classic Zombie Trilogy. P.S.

The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent.  I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.First of all, the dialog specifically.  Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned.  This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible.  Was the dialog even written down?  Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character.  It's amazing to behold.Secondly, the storyline's general arch.  Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back.  In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly.  The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations.  Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully.  This movie could not have ended any other way.Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack.  Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly.  Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude.  Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.And now we FINALLY, FINALLY have a three-disc special edition of the brilliance.  This was long overdue.  I loved my other copy because I love movies more than extras, but man is it good to know that this has been given some more treatment.  Now we have all the more materials to use to love this work of art better than ever before!--PolarisDiB", "qas": [{"question": "How is the style?", "id": "d3d2bdb54e7d9b2fff49e308128fec22", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Just because the characters are quirky and interesting doesn't mean the movie is funny or good.

That they are a simple people who live off the land, waste nothing and only desire to be left alone to live in peace on the land they inherited from their ancestors. He particularly grows fond of \"Kicking Bird\" played by Graham Greene.There is plenty of excitement between the Buffalo (ttonka) Hunt, the fight with the Pawnee and the clash between the Cavalry Soldiers and the Sioux.

Roberto Benigni is a brilliant comic actor and is certainly at the top of his game in this movie. Some scenes such as his impersonation of the fascist lecturer in the  Italian primary school are outstanding. In this scene, Benigni has posed as  the lecturer in order to get close to the teacher he is in love with.  Unfortunately before Benigni can approach her, he is asked to give the  students a lecture on Aryan racial superiority. So in a moment of genius  the swarthy, dark-haired Benigni strips down to his boxer shorts and  demonstrates his \"perfect Aryan features\".While I enjoyed the comic  genius of the film, I was deeply disturbed by its fictitious, understated  portrayal of the Nazi death camp. Anyone who has encountered documentary  footage and source material from the holocaust can see staggering contrasts  between the fictional death camp in \"Life is Beautiful\" and the real thing.  For example, real death camp prisoners would never have been as healthy  looking and well fed when disembarking from the cattle cars as the ones in  \"Life is Beautiful\". They would have been greeted with beatings, killings  and an instant sense of what the place was all about. If the child, Joshua  had survived for more than a few hours (which was almost impossible) he  would have been under no illusion about what kind of place he was in. If  you don't believe me then read the accounts of Elie Weisel and other  youthful survivors of the death camp. What life people clung to in such  places was brutal. The horror was so total and so pervasive that even a  genius like Roberto Benigni would never have successfully convinced his son  that the whole thing was a game.Does this make \"Life is Beautiful\" a bad  movie? Well, it does and it doesn't. The dramatic quality of the film is  superb. Unfortunately, the only way the film was able to float its main  premise-that a loving father could fool his son into thinking that a deadly  situation was just a game-was to tone down the holocaust. This is a  terribly irresponsible thing to do for the sake of dramatic quality.

Yes, there are moments where you laugh, but this is hardly a piece that can be taken lightly.  Perhaps Benigni shouldn't have used the Holocaust as a background for his story as that has seemed to offend many viewers, people who believe that it does not do the horrible historical event justice.  Being that I am not (Jewish) I cannot know the extent of this offense...However, I don't believe Benigni's intention was to dishonor the event in any way.  Furthermore, this movie is fiction, and is NOT, and has never claimed to be, a movie based on the events of the Holocaust.This film is not about the Holocaust.  It is about a beautiful and loving family in adverse times, and the sacrifices parents are willing to make to maintain the innocent mind of their beloved child.  This film is an expression of humanity, and survival.Some people I've spoken with expressed their disgust for the film's title, since the ending's tragedy does not seem to fit the meaning of the title.  I disagree.  The laughter and tears are an equal summation of the title - the beauty of the tragedy is the love that lives on, and that is passed down from one generation to the next.

It is a heartwarming affirmation of life, as Guido tries to shield his son from the horrors of the camp by making a game out of it.  Guido makes up the rules as he goes along: \"You must hide and never let the angry people [the guards] see you - we get 50 points for every day you stay hidden!\"There are many things to like about the film.  The performances are charming (Benigni won an Oscar as Guido).  The screenplay is well-constructed, in that it doesn't shy away from the reality of the holocaust (e.g., Guido's elderly uncle is dispatched in the gas chamber), but can still be sweet and funny.  In fact, the jarring effect of arriving at the concentration camp is more pronounced in this film because it's so farcical and lighthearted in the beginning.This DVD version has clean video and audio (at least, on the Italian track - I have not listened to the dubbed version).  Unfortunately, as is typical of Mirimax, the extras on the DVD are mostly promotional materials.  For example, the Making Of featurette is essentially a half hour of sound bits from people praising the film.

It is well-known that Steven Spielberg hated the film because he felt it belittled the Holocaust.

This film is similiar to Malick's previous works, Days of Heaven and Badlands, where there are voice tracks of the character's thoughts as they progress through events.  The movie spends a lot of time  developing several key characters in an infantry company; a young soldier labeled as a non-team player, a battle-wise first sergeant, a company  commander who stands up against his battalion commander during an attack that is causing high losses, and the battalion commander whose personal ambitions over-ride his soldiers' welfare.  The film is good, but can be depressing and appear to drag with the character's thoughts and dreams, but it does approach what life must have been like for the soldiers serving during war; long periods of boredom and depression, broken by short bursts of terrifying combat.  The film is much different from Saving Private Ryan, but unfortunately receives a lot of critical  comparison because it was released shortly afterward.  Good film, Nick Nolte is excellent as a battalion commander and John Cusak does a  brief appearance in a tense battle to seize a hilltop.

It basically explains all the events that occured regarding the witch that were mentioned in the movie with more detail and explanation.

Before you can really make an accurate apprasial of how effective this movie was, you have to distance yourself from the expectations generated by the brilliant original Star Wars Trilogy.  In making the Phantom Menace, Lucas had the difficult problem of being true to the original while still statisfying the expectations of a more modern audience.  On top of that, there were certain things that had to be said, set-up, and introduced in the Phantom Menace to provide groundwork for later sequels.  Considering how many objects Lucas was juggling, he did a tremendous job. The Phantom Menace looks as technologicly beautiful as any movie ever made.  The special effects are amazing and, at least in this category, the Phantom Menace far outpaces the original series.  Every scene is spectacular on a scope the original trilogy could only dream of.  There are a myriad of bizzare and interesting characters floating, not just in the center of the frame, but around the corners in flashes and only for split seconds.  Just that aspect alone warrants multiple viewings. The performances are rock solid, Liam Neeson is perfect in the role of a jedi master, and takes his cues with an appreciative nod to the great Alec Guiness whose performance as the original Obi-Wan Kenobi is the backbone of the whole star wars series.  Ewan McGreggor is marvelous too and it will be very entertaining to see him in an expanded role in the further sequels. The criticisms of this film have been that the characters are too two dimensional, that the plot is too similar to the origninals, and that too much of the action takes place in a political forum.  My answer is that the characters are developed, it is just done extremely subtly and with minor gestures and choice of words rather than in-your-face gestures, certain plotlines are similar but in an attempt to make the movie true to the originals some overlap is inevitable, and the political aspect is, and has always been, a major component in this fantasy series and so was unavoidable.  In short, the Phantom Menace is a spectacular movie.  Although it doesn't quite capture the nostalgia of the original Star Wars, it suceeds admirably in continuing the story without disturbing the pedistal the first movies established.  As with all Star Wars movies, there is a lot more subtly going on than any critic is likely to recognize.  Furthermore, it is unfair to judge the Phanom Menace after only one or two viewings when most people have seen the original trilogy numerous times and have picked up every little nuance and detail.  The original series seems rich on the strength of those multiple viewings and multiple discoveries, it is unfair to consider the Phantom Menace less until it has been given an equal examination.", "qas": [{"question": "How are the special effects?", "id": "123edc2abf429491bd7a7029f6ba393d", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The Phantom Menace is pretty good, but I don't find it to be a classic.

I will not buy the &quot;first&quot; three either (unless they release a NON-special edition version). I'm not going to make Lucas or Fox any richer on my dollar.I'm not going to talk about what this movie could have been. Everybody has their theories about what they wanted to see on that screen after waiting 20 years. I want to approach this movie on it's own, and not as part of a universe. The main reason that Alien 3 was so disappointing was because of the story line inconsistency with the previous movies. It was terrible what that film did to the story that Scott and Cameron had built up, but taken on it's own it's not really that bad of a film. I wanted to give the Menace the same chance.To address some arguments before I begin. First, as far as I know, in 1977, Star Wars was not made for children. Star Wars did not cater to children. It had audiences from 5 to 75 fascinated. Not just 3-13 year old future Gen-Xers, but all audiences fell in love with that movie. In LA, people in their twenties and thirties went to see Star Wars two to three times a day. This film was ground breaking and blew people's minds. Sure, when you see \"Star Wars\" or \"2001:A Space Odyssey\" now, it is possible to forget the impact these movies had. Taken in context of when they were released, these movies inspired, confused, and awed audiences of ALL AGES world wide.Second, I state that children do not need to be catered to. When I was eight years old I saw one of the greatest films ever made, Raiders of the Lost Arc. At that time in my then short life, Raiders was the most incredible thing that I had ever seen. As an eight-year-old, believe it or not, I did not need a flatulant pack animal or a goofy sidekick or a \"yippee\" child to keep my attention. I enjoyed a movie that was able to be very fun and intelligent on it's own merits.Now on to the menace. The first thing seen in this movie are bug-like aliens who have overdubbed Asian accents that don't match their lip movements. In the beginning of this epic space opera, the director starts us off with the equivalent to what we see at 2:00 in the morning watching 70's Kung Fu movies. Bad overdubbing.Next we get our buddy. The Jar-ster. I don't think I need to comment. Within the first two minutes on screen the Biggs quotes Wayne's World. How \"current\" to make reference to a movie that came out in 1991. I'm sure at least half of the 1300+ reviews below me have gone into how hideous this character is, so I don't need to. The Phantom Edit speaks for millions....\"exsqueeze me\"?????!?!?!?!?The \"bad guys\" in this film, rather than the menacing Stormtroopers, are a group of rickety robots. They don't have any emotional quality to them, so the only way to make them threatening is to show them in immense numbers. Who are the robots the biggest threat to? The CG gungens. Oh...no real loss there. The gungens are rather annoying anyway, and watching the CG robots attack the CG gungens doesn't really impact the film viewer in any way.The pod race was 80% there. The sports announcers really took from that scene. It brought the movie out of \"long ago and far away\" to USA Saturday Football game. It totally killed the suspension of disbelief that a viewer tries to build up. Also, the race was so ... boring that Jabba even fell asleep. Yippee!What I put above are what would give this film two or three stars. Add into the mix that Darth Vader built C-3PO, the really stupid space battle where Anakin accidentally blows up the robot control ship...whoops, the E.T.'s that were in the Galactic Council. The stupid accents given to every alien race, rather than developing a creative language like Jawwa, Huttes, and Ewok. Changing the Zen philosophies of \"Empire\" into mitochondria...*cough* I mean midichlorians.What gives this film the 0-1 star rating is the lack of character. I don't give ... about special effects. Clerks, Rear Window, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, and Goodfellas had hardly any special effects, but are superior films because the characters are fascinating. Special Effects can only help a movie, and will never make a movie great unless there is meat underneath them. As the now gone Eon Magazine said, Obi-Wan was basically a glorified mechanic in this film. His job was to...fix the ship. At last Darth Maul will have his revenge. For what? Qui-gon is on the outs with the Jedi council...why?My Phantom edit: Give Qui-gon and Darth Maul more flushing out and back story. Cut out the gungens completely. Edit the space battle so it's exciting. Cut the slave stuff out. We've spent 3 movies on Tatooine now, time to move on. Spend an additional 20 minutes on Corsecant (sp?). Spend 20 fewer minutes on Tatooine. Spend a lot less time on gungen planet. Try to edit the other action sequences to be as exciting as the light saber duels. There's too much to fix, so I maintain my 0-1 star rating. I hope the second film will be better, but I'm not holding my breath.

But the problem isn't with the movie itself, which is first-rate.  There were just too many people who had their own ideas of what the first new Star Wars film in nearly a generation should be like for creator George Lucas to possibly satisfy.  Sadly, those persons' negative reviews have somewhat marred an otherwise phenomenal blockbuster, which by any well-reasoned definition is a highly worthy extension of the beloved Star Wars mythos.Even the film's critics agree that this movie looks spectacular.  Lucas spared no expense in the set design and special effects, and the result is simply magical.  From the iconic architecture of the planet Naboo to the wastes of Tatooine and the cold reaches of space, everything shimmers with life and you almost feel like you could walk right into the story yourself. Beyond that, the story itself is excellent and in line with the familiar Star Wars formula of good vs. evil on an interplanetary scale.  Likewise, the cast is terrific and does a tremendous job.  Liam Neeson is an commanding Qui-Gon Jinn who dominates every scene he is in, and Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi just growing into his full power but clearly destined to be one of the greatest Jedi of all.  Natalie Portman's Padme is appealing and believable, and Jake Lloyd is surprisingly effective as the ill-fated Anakin Skywalker.  Ian McDiarmid lends a sinister air as the shadowy Senator Palpatine, whose suave elegance barely conceals his true dark nature.Yes, there is Jar Jar Binks, and while Jar Jar does occasionally strike a funny note he is more often annoying.  And young Mr. Lloyd does have to utter some rather painful lines from time to time.  But these minor flaws hardly hinder the overall drama, which is quite strong.  Particularly moving is Anakin's final dialogue with his mother, when he stands at the crossroads of his destiny and realizes that once he chooses which path to take, he can never look back. Of course there is also the famous pod race, a deadly race against fate that shoots across the Tatooine desert like lightning. The masterful extended climax (divided amongst no less than four different battles)is incredibly exciting.  Here young Anakin foreshadows Luke Skywalker's later Death Star heroics, and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face the diabolical Darth Maul in an incredible display of lightsaber wizardry.No review of this film would be complete without mention of John Williams's usual fantastic score.  The soundtrack is magnificent, one of the most thrilling any movie has ever had, and it should've been used a bit more liberally in &quot;Attack of the Clones.&quot;Not only is the movie great, but the DVD is something special too.

From 1984 to 1998, there were no Star Wars movies. Was it because George was waiting for technology to catch up, so he could make the type of movie that he envisioned in the early 70's? Whatever the case, Episode I has many frustrating moments, and some cool and relevant sequences that tell the story well. First, the bad: Starting with the script.....this movie isn't one that the average person is going to memorize, because it isn't simplistic like episodes 4, 5, and 6. Did George deliberately make the script a sophisticated one, to go with the high tech environment? With so much sophistication in the environment, as well as all of the high-tech gadgets, etc., could one really say, \"Can someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?\" Sure, life was simpler and more tangible a few decades ago, and movies were a reflection of it. The problem with The Phantom Menace is that there's too much emphasis on certain scenes, such as the pod races, and droid battles. A large chunk of the movie is spent highlighting Anakin's talents, but nothing in the form of depicting any hint of forthcoming evil that would contribute to his downfall in the next two films. I found myself getting bored during the pod race sequence, because too much time was spent on the special effects. I believe in telling a part of a story in a much shorter format, and not dwell on it, such as the Jabba the Hutt sequence in Return of the Jedi. Phantom Menace doesn't move along as efficiently as episodes 4-6, and boredom is the result. Boredom also stems from not initially following the sophisticated (and somewhat complicated) script. Like I mentioned, it isn't as tangible as one would want when it comes to the Star Wars franchise, which I think is a reflection of the times, as well as George's vision. It's very interesting that this movie (despite its complexities) is more or less a kid's movie. Now, the good: I certainly like the much higher level of skill that the jedi knights and sith lords display in lightsaber duels. Darth Maul is spectacular, and it is the duel with Qui-Gon that actually saves this movie from plunging into the abyss. I can't help but laugh when seeing the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader in Episode 4--It was absolutely PATHETIC in terms of skill level. I know that Darth and Obi-Wan are older then, but their skill level is very inferior to what we see in 1,2,3,5, and 6. But George gets away with these things, and the loyal fans don't mind. I like the fact that he built the jedis and siths into skilled warriors, but it represents one of several things that don't transition well in subsequent films. Again, we give George a free pass. It's too bad that Yoda is a puppet in this one, and looks so different from the Yoda in the rest of the movies. This movie lacks attitude, for the most part, but it's understandable in a way, because it features a child, and the story has to be built around that. The musical score is fantastic as usual, as John Williams turns out another masterpiece that's a lot different from the the first 3 movies. I particularly like the music during the lightsaber battles.  The Phantom Menace is a movie that I've come to appreciate a little more in the past few years, after the next two movies were completed. I expect its popularity to grow a little in the coming years. Despite several areas of frustration, I still give this movie 4 stars, because of the cool environments and Darth Maul, who by the way should've been kept around for one more film.

It had great special effects, but everything else was just... ok. The thing that made the first Star Wars films great is that they are extremely well rounded and balanced,  and succeed in all of the areas. This movie attempted to recreate that  previous success, but didn't quite make it.In this space-age tale,  Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin (two jedis from the Jedi council, one of  which is already well known) try to end a trade dispute which has resulted  in a blockade going up around the planet known as &quot;Naboo&quot;.  However, after an assassination attempt, they are forced to flee to Naboo,  where they meet some interesting people, including Princess Amidala (played  by Natalie Portman). From there they make a desperate attempt to visit a  political council on the faraway planet of Coruscant. On the way they stop  off on Tatooine and end up picking up Anakin Skywalker, a.k.a. Darth Vader.  He's much younger, though, and not at all menacing.After the entire  party reaches Coruscant, they do some things (sorry, I'm low on big words  right now), and eventually decide to head back to save the planet (Naboo).  The movie has some good scenes towards the end, and the lightsaber duel is  awesome- it's like acrobatics with a little bloodthirst.The reason this  movie doesn't quite make it is that the storyline is only marginally good,  the characters aren't developed enough, and frankly, Jar Jar Binks ends up  as one of those characters you just wish would be put out of their misery  with a sledge hammer... However, the movie does have great special effects,  and offers a look into Star Wars history. No, this movie is not as good an  achievment as the earlier movies in the series, but it is worth seeing.  And, though it's not a true epic, you probably will enjoy it.

At least in the original trilogy the story was easy to comprehend. An evil empire. A big, bad Death Star that can destroy entire planets. A princess that needs rescuing. It was simple, but it worked. With this new trilogy, George Lucas seemed to think that computer fx was all he needed to make a great movie. The story, obviously was secondary. As was the acting.

It did have a few good things to offer us \"old fans\", but not enough to give this even a 3 star rating. Here is where I think the film succeeded and where it failed.The good:1) The visual fx. Wow.

Natalie Portman is especially bad here. Sorry, but it's true. Her acting is horrible.2) Yoda. While it's great to see the old Jedi Master again, he doesn't look like the Yoda we remember. He looks...well, I'm not sure. But does have fat lips. And a strange head.3) The story. As stated earlier, it's too confusing and many times just makes no sense.

He's the worst one of them all. He's a very stupid, annoying and just plain dumb character. He's not funny. He adds nothing to the story. Sure, the film needed some humor, but not like this!

Now mind you, I am not the biggest Star Wars fan but I do love all of the movies, have most of the old toys and love it when my nephew can quote a line or tell me the relations between the characters. Once this film was released on video (widescreen), something weird happened. Everything flowed alot better. Perhaps it was because there not claustrophobia from the hundreds occupying the theater, or I could finally hear the dialogue crystal clear, as opposed to the new and improved theater sounds, but this film was incredibaly entertaining and while I can still see some of my earlier points come up, I also know that once the series is done, I don't think people will bag on this film much. I think people are bagging on this the way they first ripped apart Back to the Future 2, until the series was complete and now it seems to be everyone's favorite. Sure some of the acting is wooden, but this film isn't supposed to be the involving story of Luke discovering his manhood and his place in the universe, but rather a political film about the unraveling of the galaxy and how everything is beginning to hit the fan. If you still can not understand Jar Jar, here's an idea... closed caption and just think his species has to die, because he or they are not in the last films. Afterwards, I rubbed my head thinking something was wrong with me--was this the same film that I bagged on when it arrived in the theaters? It was and yet everything was clearer than before--and the visuals were not in my face, but rather atmospheric on the television screen. Please, dear people--don't bag too hard because when the series is over, I'm sure you will like this one as well. .... So far this whole series was very good and I can not wait to see this epic completed--and I am not even a huge Star Wars fan but I do like to see credit where credit is due. However, I do have something to say to George Lucas about the Phantom Menace--the only reason why the Sand people shooting at the pods is funny is because we have seen A NEW HOPE--however, years from now when the series is done and kids want to watch it, it will be very hard to just start at EPISODE 1--because the injokes simply will not resonate and they may be forced to track backwards anyway.

It is not hard to see why. In common with earlier STAR WARS films, it is a mix of similar ingredients: the profound, the comic, the noble, the villainous, the familiar, the alien, combined with newly developed action sequences that would have been impossible before CGI, which George Lucas had an enormous role in creating. The problem is that, although these elements are all present, they are not blended in satisfying proportions. Very serious subjects from slavery to ruminations with messianic overtones take a back seat to broad slapstick and often crude cartoonish comedy geared toward children. Yet, the more interesting thematic or complex plot elements--however scattered they are--would be unintelligible to children, so it's impossible to determine what the target audience was.Because the tone of PHANTOM MENACE is impossible to gauge--scenes of potential gravity suddenly interrupted by the cheapest gags, it is ultimately unsatisfying. It also is very difficult to see how it fits in the STAR WARS saga in general. The chance meeting with a very young child named Anakin linking it with the story is treated as a subplot, and should have been dealt with in a much more inspired fashion; it should have been the core of the film or even been edited with ATTACK OF THE CLONES into a single film (CLONES  would need heavy editing, but it does anyway). Because PHANTOM MENACE is a separate film, much of the action that unfolds in the next installment has no basis or normal chronological continuity. In PHANTOM MENACE, for example, Anakin and Padme are separated by almost a generation, Padme being closer to the age of Anakin's mother than the boy. So of course there is no romantic hint here. Yet in the next episode, the age distinction seems to be lowered to no more than four or five years, and Anakin reveals that he has been in love with Padme since their first meeting. Pre-pubescnet kids don't think about much-older persons in these terms so it can't be the same Anakin, and seems to refer to a film that doesn't exist. In PHANTOM MENACE, the child Anakin merely asks if Padme is an \"angel,\" partly wishing that she is, of course, so she can rescue his mother and him from enslavement.PHANTOM MENACE thus seems to stand on its own, which must certainly not have been the intent. It is clear that despite claims to the contrary, Lucas never had all of this worked out; it must only have been a very rough outline he had been mulling over. He was apparently not concerned about the details that he set in motion during the initial three films. Now it is Qui-Gon who is Obi-Wan's mentor, not Yoda, as was stated countless times in the original films. Now the Force is not \"something which surrounds us and binds the universe together\" as Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan told us in the first film (1977)--a very Eastern concept; it is, rather, a genetic quirk resulting from an overabundance of \"midi-chlorians\" in the blood. The Jedi thus are no longer beings of great spiritual nobility so much as the result of chromosomal \"superiority\"--uncomfortably reminiscent of crackpot early 20th-century eugenics used to claim the superiority of whites over other races or Aryans over Semites (Hitler's version). It saps STAR WARS of its mythic status. It is a relief that at least the \"midi-chlorian\" eugenics are dropped in Episode II.Overall, the few deeper ideas are entirely overwhelmed by CG special effects, the troubling demystification, and silly comedy suitable for kids' TV, most notably personified by the CGI character of Jar Jar Binks, an annoying, accident-prone \"Gungan\" who uses language in ways reminiscent of racist African-American stereotypes from the 1930s. One has to wonder how Mr. Lucas missed the latter appalling problem, or worse, if he intended it. A few minutes of Jar Jar's irritating antics would be more than enough to spoil any scene, but his unrelenting presence in every nearly every for over two hours sours anything of interest. The film has a few moments of intensity and even emotion here and there, but they are limited and eclipsed by the rest of the action; with plot and treatment so spotty, the film must be considered a failure.", "qas": [{"question": "How much money is needed?", "id": "5c34a91e312664d87053cda4c926d39c", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace was the most anticipated film of all time.

I was left totally dry by this huge revelation, and if a dramatic high point of the movie left me dry, imagine how I felt about the rest of it.This movie tries to mix live action with animation. That is difficult and has seldom given good results. Maybe \"the mummy returns\" was successful, but this was not.The Computer graphic (CG) world left me emotionless. The battle scenes looked like a video game, how can I get excited about that? Plus, by now I have seen enough CG epic battle scenes to last me a lifetime, The Mummy, Star Wars I, Final Fantasy, Mummy II, all featured epic battle scenes with a cast of one (computer programmer, that is).

By contrast the similar journey in Disney's \"Atlantis\" had me squirming out of my seat with excitment.The pod race is great, it's worth watching and has sparks of inspiration. The double headed announcer that does his own color was funny and creative, the sand people taking pot shots at the racers, the Ben Hur inspired race, Anakin rewiring his pod in the middle of the race - all great stuff.We all agree that Jar Jar Binks was a mistake. What makes it unforgiveable is that they made exactly the same mistake 20 years ago in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" where C-3PO was annoyingly obnoxious.

Do I think he, along with the Neimoidians, are racial stereotypes of Jamaicans and Asians respectively? No. The story is good but it can plod along at a very sluggish pace. For instance, once the story gets to Tatooine, they could've trimmed a few scenes, the Podrace imparticular. And some scenes on Coruscant feel slow as well, like the pointless scenes of watching Palpatine take the Queen to her apartment suite. Its brief but un-necessary. Liam Neeson does an admirable job as Qui-Gon, portraying him as a caring yet very formidable warrior. Ewan McGregor portrays Obi-Wan as a young, headstrong Jedi. The character at least goes through development over the course of the prequel trilogy and he'll eventually become the character from the \"first\" (fourth) film. Natalie Portman is alright as Queen Amidala but she's no Princess Leia. Though her hairdos can outdo Leia's and both are good with a blaster, the way the character's acted out comes across as wooden and stiff. And when Portman actually is the Queen, where does that deep, accented way of speaking come from? Is that Keira Knightley dubbing her voice when she's in the Queen's clothes? I don't know. And then there's Jake Lloyd, who's able to take the concept of what Anakin is to become in the future and make the character less intimidating. To know that in Vader's youth, he was prone to shout \"Yipee!\" and be called \"Ani\". That's not very threatening! Though I will give him credit for at least trying, its just that they did not capture the best (if there is any) performances of the actor and I'm pretty sure Lucas and the producers could've done A LOT better. There are some familiar faces from the original movies; Kenny Baker as R2-D2 (not much has changed over the course of six films) and his first meeting with a pre-gold plated C-3PO (still played by Anthony Daniels) and Ian McDiarmid as Senator (later Supreme Chancellor) Palpatine and his sinister alter ego, Darth Sidious. Darth Maul is a formidable villain for the film, though there always seems to be a co-villain in the newer films instead of just one singular villain, but I guess for all six you can count the Emperor as an over-arching villain, but I digress. And there are cameos by a young Jabba the Hutt, some Wookies in the Senate scene and General Zod himself, Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Vallorum. The fight scenes are some the best, the four different fights at the climax being the standout. And its time for to once again praise John Williams.

The visuals of the pod race are impressive, but the stretching of disbelief, even in a sci-fi fantasy, of a tyke flying like an ace, IS asking too much. I won't rehash the multitude of story problems. Other reviews posted here cover them well enough. Suffice to say, the ship - the legacy - of Star Wars began to sink here.

I think the biggest problem was George Lucas getting so wrapped up in all of today's computer technology that he forgot the basics that got him where he is today.What I really enjoyed about the original Star Wars trilogy is that everything is rather believeable. All the monsters, all the characters are real life-like. Look at the Ewoks, for instance. Now imagine if all the Ewoks were computer generated like Jar-Jar Binks. It would have looked horrible. It's so obvious to tell the difference between a real character and computer generated character in a movie when they're standing side by side. I really hated in Episode I how so much of it was computer generated scenes, such as the whole war near the end. It simply doesn't have the same effect. I mean, I thought I'm suppose to be watching something believeable, not Toy Story.Another thing was the fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon.  As much as I enjoyed it, and hated seeing Darth Maul killed (he was by far my favorite character in Episode I...now why didn't he get more lines?!), it was probably the most anti-climatic battle ever.  Look at Luke vs. Vader from Return of the Jedi.  The emotion that poured out of Luke after Vader saying perhaps he could turn Leia to the dark side as he screamed out, \"NOOOO!\" and the music kicked in and Luke pounded away on him until he cut off his hand.  Now look at the Episode I fight scene.  I loved that music, however where was it when they die?  When Darth Maul gets killed (in a rather ...way, too), it's like dead silence.  No music, no nothing, just silence.  Where the emotion?  The power that music can play is incredible, but the use of music in Episode I wasn't to its full potential (much like the rest of the movie wasn't at its full potential).Episode I seemed to be more about flashy costumes and characters rather than story. Lucas needs to return to the basics of solid storytelling and using real characters, not all this computer animated garbage.I'm expecting a lot more out of Episode II.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the film?", "id": "dcc314c9d3769b911e6436b56c5e8b02", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Was Episode One worth all the hype?

Well, the originals featured some incredibly ham fisted acting too, we were just younger then.

I can guarantee that you will not find better CGI elsewhere, and the story line, while somewhat obtuse, has great pacing and is fairly engaging, even touching at points.  Moreover, the acting is probably better than in the originals.  Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor are accomplished actors in their own rights, and Nathalie Portman and Jake Lloyd proved themselves to be burgeoning talents.As for the DVD, I was pretty much blown away.  The sound and picture quality are literally without parallel.  I have never appreciated the technology of my home theater system more than when I first popped in this DVD.  To put things in perspective, my dog was actually walking from speaker to speaker, trying to figure out who was talking!  The picture is brilliantly sharp, and the included THX tool assures that your levels are properly adjusted (assuming you feel like going to the trouble of using it).The extras are pretty standard, but no less enjoyable for that fact.  George Lucas' commentary offers some interesting insight into the film, both in its creation and its final form.  The cut scenes from the pod race are spectacular.  Although far too long to include in the body of the movie, they are immensely enjoyable to watch.  It is important to note that it is not an option to view these scenes within the movie, as has been suggested by other reviewers.  Some of them are included in the movie, as well as some extended transition scenes, but the viewer has no control over which ones.All in all I found \"Phantom Menace\" to be a highly enjoyable, if not particularly deep movie.

Star Wars Episode One. It sounds more exciting than the actual experience of watching this slow, drab, feckless piece of work. I'm a huge Star Wars (episode 4-6) fan like many others but this new installment was bad Han Solo not firing first bad.Story (lacked originality): The story is fundamentally sound there is good vs. bad and the battles for who will prevail. Jedi knights get entangled in rescuing themselves along with a queen from an evil corrupt federation. There are amusing fights with the Federation standard robot army. They bounce around the galaxy and end up finding a very young boy on a remote planet we've already been to TWO times before. The boy displays natural ability in regards to the force but lacks any acting talent. A cool evil sith lord is introduced but given an anorexic amount of lines. Viewers will visit the galactic capital Coursant but this is less entertaining then a Disneyland commercial. These stories are meant to sweep us away and take us to new worlds where we're simply awed and amazed. I ended up being awed by how bad the acting and script were and amazed my beloved series has been reduced to dribble.Acting (mostly below average): Do I start with the bad news or the good news. Well I don't really have a whole lot of good news except several gifted actors/actresses starred in this movie (Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neelson plus the original C-3PO actor). The problem was none of there performances were above par when compared to there previous works. In fact this movie didn't bring out there talent but seemed to siphon it. Then there are the already bad actors. There performances are out right criminal. We're stuck watching the main character a young boy who for one is a bad actor and for two is put in ridicules situations that again took away from this movie. I can't even start with Jar Jar yet it hurts too much to speak his name.Script (god awful): George Lucas must have been on the can when he wrote this script. The lines are chalky and lack originality. You're stuck time after time hearing a regurgitated lines stolen from the original movies. The script feels like jigsaw puzzles that doesn't have any of the right pieces. There isn't smooth transition from one part of the movie to the next. It all feels either rushed or awkward. The movie also becomes very complex but in a 20 car pile up sort of way. Your shown glimpses of the galactic senate and taken into the honored Jedi Counsel Halls but no one seems to have motives that make sense. The Federation is being very naughty to the planet of Naboo but why doesn't the galactic republic army crush them? Is there a galactic republic army? If not then how do they maintain power since no strong government ever does without a military. Why doesn't the Federation simply attack Crousant and go for the gold if they don't have a military? You literally see about ten Galactic soldiers I mean this is the capital for the whole universe and there is only ten soldiers come on give me a break. Unfortunately not even Yodas few witty lines could save us from this mostly stale experience. Yoda mostly reminded me that this movie isn't about creating a new cutting edge craft but about attempting to relive the past.Music (Fair): The music as a whole is only fair. I'm not blaming John Williams the man had nothing to work with. That being said the music is one of the better parts to this movie. The end Sith battle music is powerful with a strong chorus added to the orchestra. The effect was moving but little to late in this already flat experience.Most the fight scenes are cool but others are ruined by Jar Jar and Anakin. The end Sith lord light saber battle actual had some emotion. The only problem was the Sith lord was the most interesting character and he was never given a chance to shine due to him not given hardly any lines or back story. He does however wield a sweet double bladed light saber. All this being said a lot of younger viewers love this new installment and fail to see the plethora of flaws that ensue.

However the script  is enough to make you wince. The first Star Wars movie sounded unedited,  and so does this.Ray Park is another bone of contention with me. He's a  superb actor, brilliant in the fight sequence, and turns his lines into  something truly sinister. So why wasn't more made of his character? Darth  Maul was fantastic but he only appears once or twice, and dies without even  a last word. He hardly even has a first word, come to that.Overall, the  story is debatable, the visual aspects stunning, the characters held up by  good acting, the script appalling but rescued again by the actors.

Were they physically prevented from doing the thing that we normally think of when the word \"acting\" is mentioned?  I mean, blurting out some dialogue, or reciting it as if you're making an emotionless statement, that's not acting.  Seriously, this is what I expect from fifth graders appearing in their very first school play.  It's just astonishes me every time one of the characters says something.  It's like a big, dumb, obvious summary of what's going on at the moment.  \"Mom, I'm not a slave any more!\"  Mom:  \"All your dreams have come true.\"  Said with all the emotion of \"Oh, you remembered to pick up the potato chips from the store.\"  Probably 80% of the dialogue in this movie is like this.  Most first-time script readthroughs on a soap opera must be far superior to this.  Seriously, Scooby Doo has  better acting - much, much better.

And even then, it's not every member of the entire cast like it is here.Then of course there's Jar Jar, the baby talking donkey.  I guess Lucas was really reaching out for the 2 and under audience.  And the big battle at the end, with a villain we hardly know, so there's really no drama there (except what can be created with CGI), and he looks downright silly in that Halloween face paint.

He ACCIDENTALLY flies into the space station, then while shooting at some droids, ACCIDENTALLY hits the main reactor, which nicely waits for him to get to a safe distance before exploding.  Good grief, it's too stupid and pathetic to even bother criticizing.Overall, this is an astonishingly bad movie, with dialogue that keeps one in a constant state of \"What the **** did I just see?\".  I mean, constantly,. throughout the whole film.

But I did love the originals. I think people remember the original trilogy when they were like 12 and so nobody minded all the unrealistic and childish elements then. As kids, Star  Wars was flawless. The scene in &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; still irks  me, where they land inside a giant worm's stomach and of course, there is  air pressure and gravity just like on Earth, even though they are in an  asteroid! Nobody even checks to see if its safe to leave the ship.Episode I was superior in many aspects. NOTHING in the old trilogy is  anywhere near as visually stunning as Naboo and Corusant. Those two things  alone make the movie worth watching. The costumes, and the ships are much  sleeker and more believable than the originals ever were. The light saber  duel was ten times more exciting than anything in the first trio. Even John  Williams' score &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is unforgettable and far  beyond any of the original music. As for Jar Jar being annoying, yes, he  was annoying, but that didn't bother me a bit! Because he was PLAYING an  annoying character! He was SUPPOSED to be annoying. He annoyed Obi and  Qui-Gon too. That was part of the necessary comic relief to play as a foil  to the stoic Jedi.As for the Jedi acting stiff, well of course they  were, THEY ARE JEDI! Jedi aren't supposed to be emotional. And still I  really felt for Qui-Gon in the end. Anakin I must admit didn't act all too  well. But what really irks me about TPM are the small things. The robot  going; &quot;Roger Roger&quot; made me want to scream; &quot;IS THIS  SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS?&quot; And what I hated most, the way most people  felt about Jar Jar, is how I felt about that dumb two headed announcer. I  mean he looked so cartoonish, and he sounded just like Howard Cosell! That  was simply too much of a stretch of the imagination. But the plot, in my  mind, was superb. Those who didn't like it didn't understand it maybe. It  was rather deeper than the others.

They waited impatiently, some slept on the streets, so eager to get a ticket for the Phantom Menace, they saw Episode 1.  They were unimpressed.  How surprising!  Nothing is worse for a film than a mountain of hype built up prior to it.  It will never, ever reach those lofty expectations.Thankfully my expectations were low.  I enjoyed the first three Star Wars movies but my enjoyment never matured into an obsession.  They were fine, not great.  Science Fiction was never my favourite genre.  But still, I had to see Phantom Menace.  It was the biggest grosser of the Summer, even if it came with unflattering reviews.Away from the hype, The Phantom Menace isn't bad, not bad at all.  It's not a great film, but neither were the other three, or at least they never aspired to be great movies.  Phantom Menace can surely hold its own when looked at against the other three installments, and as a science fiction film it is most definitely above average.Plaudits go to the casting directors.  Liam Neeson is noble, Ewen McGregor embodies the iconic Obi-Won with a grace that was expected and Natalie Portman is adept at what is essentially a dual role.  The weaknesses are Jake Lloyd, a child with a touch too much confidence for the role.  Casting a child must be impossible.  How do you balance the cutesy factor from the annoying factor?

Not that those movies weren't great achievements in their own right, but The Incredibles is one that most families can relate to. This movie will no doubt leave the children frozen to the tv screen but its not too cartoonish for adults to enjoy as well.

Pixar's movies to me posess the magic and entertainment factor that Disney movies used to and where Disney lacks, Pixar knows how to deliver an action-packed thrill ride everytime.Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, and Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl get married and are determined to balance married life with their duties as superheroes. But one day, the supers begin to be sued for their help. They become too big of a liability, so the government relocates them to normal lives, forbidden to do their work. Fifteen years pass, and The incredible family has grown to 5. Jack-Jack is the baby assumed to have no super powers. Dash is quicker than lightning, and Violet can disappear and produce force fields. At this point Bob Parr is bored with normal life because all he wants to do is protect the people but he isnt allowed to. One day something happens that draws Mr. Incredible back into the biggest mission of his life, as well as the rest of the Incredible family. That's all I will give away from the movie, but be ready for pretty much non-stop action until the end.This dvd set is worth the price.

He and his wife, Elastigirl, have been ordered to give up their superhero careers and are living in a witness protection program as if they are just your average humans.  Then Bob is approached about a top-secret assignment and everything changes.This story is well written and the characters are more human than a lot of characters who are actually human.  They have emotions and big hearts and they love, make sacrifices, discover truths about each other and themselves, suffer, and feel loss.  They also argue about which is the right turn on the freeway and deal with unruly kids who have strong wills and their own minds about how things should work.

It has a broad appeal to every member of the family without being pithy.  Dads in the audience may identify with Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, who traded in his cape, youthful vigor and life of daring adventures for a pleasant house in the suburbs, wife, children and a desultory job at an insurance company.  He now has to deal with a life of regrets and missed opportunities of glory.  Once, he was the nation's hero, now he is the family provider whose only opportunity for \"glory\" is to please his boss, a petty tyrant with an obvious Napoleon complex, by cheating little old ladies out of their insurance settlements.  Even the name \"Parr\" is a pun on the word \"par\" meaning \"average, normal, standard\", must be a constant reminder that he must suppress his super gifts.  We feel his despair with every defeated sigh and the realization that he is well into middle age.  His once Olympian physique lost to the ravages of a sedentary cubicle-dwelling, couch-potato life-style.  He is Howard Roark consigned to building nothing but boxy, warehouse-style discount mega-stores.Mom, like most women, seems resigned to her fate.  However, she must try to balance her domestic duties while avoiding the temptation to use her super powers to make doing the housework easier.  Imagine Samantha from Bewitched attempting to avoid the Argus-like gaze of nosy neighbor Mrs. Kravitz and you get some idea of her challenges.The kids fare no better as they try to hide their amazing abilities from their classmates and teachers.  Their talents have no place in an institutionalized society of conformity.  Poor Dash desperately wants to be on the track team just like his classmates, but his super abilities preclude him from joining.  So like most \"gifted\" children he copes in the most predictable way;  he acts disruptively in class and drives his teacher insane with his antics.  We suppose it never occurred to the teacher to try and inspire Dash to channel his remarkable gifts towards more productive activities.  Alas, the teacher prefers the old fashioned method of smashing the enormous square peg into the tiny round hole.  Many parents of gifted children will immediately identify with the struggles of the Parr family.As if the adroit social commentary on the degrading effects of mediocrity were not enough, the special effects and hellzapoppin', whiz-bang, super hero adventures would make the movie on their own.  Super-evil villain, Syndrome, lives on a high tech island that would make Bill Gates drool and Dr. Evil cry petulantly.  This is one, cool place.  Monorails, secret rocket launching pads, mindless incompetent minions, Syndrome has the whole package.  And he isn't just your run-of-the-mill, megalomaniacal villain cut in the Ernst Blofeld cloth.  He is the absolute embodiment of two of the most destructive forces in the universe--cynicism and envy.In the final analysis, The Incredibles is an action flick with a message that avoids being preachy.  Lesser directors have pummeled us with the clumsy way they present THE BIG MESSAGE until we nearly yell \"OK, we get it already!  I will trade in my SUV and get a hybrid!

One can find that the events portrayed and the way that they are portrayed can become more important than the actual impact of the film as an entertainment.The reality of the operation portrayed by the film was that the United States sent some peace keeping troops to Somalia, a country which had broken down to endemic civil war and had virtually ceased to function. The United States forces formed the view that this problem would be solved if some of the more major war lords were taken out of the equation. This film is about an attempt to kidnap the most important war lord in Somalia General Adid. The plan of the operation was to drop some highly trained troops by helicopter around a building. They were to arrest the war lord and then a convoy of vehicles was to remove him to the United States base. The operation went horribly wrong with two helicopters being shot down and the road convey getting lost. As a result a number of American soliders were killed and their bodies mutilated and dragged through the streets by the Somalis. Other troops held out and were rescued by a force of Malaysians the next morning. The operation like any real life situation contained confused elements. On one hand there was the bravery of the soldiers on the ground, both the United States soldiers who went through hell and also that of the Somalis. Whilst the individual soldiers and pilots acted generally in a way that was beyond what could reasonably be expected of them the planning of the operation and the concept behind it was deeply flawed.The film caters mainly to an American audience and for that reason it works to show the bravery of the American's involved. There can be no argument with this as they surely were. However the film tends to oversimplify the conflict by demonising the Somalis and by not looking at the sheer stupidity of what those soldiers had to go through. The reality is that the various deaths were for nothing as the United States forces were quickly pulled out. There are some minor reconstructions of history to downplay the role of the Malaysians and to suggest that the Americans had a greater role in the rescue than they in fact had.If we leave aside these minor historical quibbles the film is surprisingly effective. It conveys a complex series of battles in a way that is clear and lets the viewer understand what is happening. The portrayal of the actual fighting is also reasonably accurate. (Apart from what is said above some scences featuring Eric Banna are also made up)The film is also quite long, yet it passes quickly and one does not really have a sense of the time one is viewing it.

Certainly, it's important to show modern audiences just how horrific war can be.  But to do it to such numbing effect ends up having the reverse effect upon viewers.  We become desensitized to even the most shocking violence, and films that are meant to be anti-war are morphed into intensely graphic action films.Nothing illustrates this point better than Black Hawk Down.  While Ridley Scott's film is masterful in its technical details, and its ability to illustrate the tactics of modern warfare and how they can fall apart, it fails to establish any real sense of character or story.  We concentrate on a cast of maybe 20 or 30 soldiers as they participate in the disastrous 1993 raid in Somalia.  But because there are so many characters, and because their introductions are so brief and indistinct, it's impossible to involve yourself in the personal stakes of the raid itself.Of course, we knew nothing about the characters in Ryan before they went into battle, but we learned about them during the battle and had the added context of just what was at stake (namely, the free world itself).  Here, the purpose is somewhat questionable, and that works against the audience relating to the characters.So, without any real attachment to any of the men involved, we watch for 90 minutes as they endure hell on Earth.  But keeping track of it all is so difficult that eventually you give up, and the resulting barrage of blank warfare feels like piling on.  There's really no point in watching it, unless you really enjoy watching warfare.  In that sense, you could call it Warnography, because it's war without context.  And that's too bad, because the story behind Black Hawk Down is extraordinarily compelling.  But that's lost here in a haze of gunfire.  Then again, that might be your thing.(Note: When the film is over, we see a screen telling us that 19 Americans died and that over 1,000 Somalis died.  How did the Somalis die?  Were they all killed by Americans?  Did warring factions kill each other?  It's critical information that's left out, and makes Black Hawk Down more frustrating as a result.)", "qas": [{"question": "What is the most interesting aspect among the characters?", "id": "e2f2e6055ac39c0d040087988d1836cd", "answers": [{"text": "it fails to establish any real sense of character", "answer_start": 778}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00000K3AM", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Yet again Steven Spielberg takes a potentially fantastic movie and delivers a supreme disappointment.

The scenery is simply beautiful, with the English Channel in the backround. Then the horror starts. It's June 6, 1944. Early morning. The soldiers of Tom Hank's Ranger batallion are headed for Omaha beach in a crammed Higgins boat. They're terrified, they're sick and they're cold. Many have never seen combat before. The Germans are dropping shells all around their boat. You feel like you're there with these boys. Your hands are sweaty, you're nervous. Your nauseous. You know what they're in for. So do they, and thats what makes this scene so utterly horriying. They know when that ramp drops to unload them on the beach they're probably gonna die. Are you insane by this point??? Are you resigned to the fact that you're gonna die?? Or are you so utterly terrified that you're numb???? Speilberg captures all this. He's a brilliant director.Then the boys hit shore and the ramp drops. The first 5 soldiers are immediately shot in the head and drop. The rest clamor out of the boat, terrified. Literally running for their lives. They climb over the sides, they jump out the front and into the waist high water. Some are shot to peices. Some drown under the weight of their packs. You feel all of this. You're there!!!!! The German artillery and machine gun fire is unrelenting. It's like a wave of lead showering these poor souls from every and all angles. Again, Speilberg is a genius.Some of the boys make it to the beach.....then the real horror begins. Much has been said about the first 20 minutes of this movie.....too gruesome, too violent.

This is what they lived through. This is part of many peoples experince. This was their life. To think that there are many older people walking around today who actually LIVED THROUGH experiences like this is almost too much to think about. Do they think about it all day everyday for the rest of their lives??? Do they dream about it every night?? Do they have flashbacks that result from certain sounds or smells??? Do they relive it?? Are you insane on the inside but appear \"ok\" to the everyday passerby?? Maybe even to your family??This movie is simply wonderful. The whole movie. Tom Hanks gave this character his all. Mostly because he respected the character and knew that he was representing an entire generation of human beings for whom this experience of war was real. If you havent seen this movie, buy it now.

The problem I have is that it has been called the best WWII film. Discounting period films that didn't directly deal with war like Schindler's List, I can think of a couple of equal or better ones right off the bat. The Dirty Dozen, A Midnight Clear, Das Boot, and The Bridge on the River Kwai. This is a great movie, but the others were superior in their own ways. Dozen provided comic insight, Midnight is my favorite WWII film and shows the evolution of boys to men, it is a touching coming of age story. Das Boot is a submarine story told from the side of the Germans, they are developed as real, substantial young men who just wanted honor and glory, and you end up hoping they accomplish their mission even knowing it could be your relatives on those boats. Kwai is the Pacific Theater, but it is so good and holds up so well, I just had to include it. Alec Guinness is a stubborn proud British officer who wants to build a bridge for the Japanese as a testimony to the superiority of Britain, but doesn't see the consequences.

It explores some very troubling themes--the shadow, consumerism  and its deflection of our spiritual drives, alienation and lonliness in  urban culture, the repression of our basic instincts--just to name a few.The cinematography is stunning and uses a techique employed by the  character Tyler Durden in the film:  Tyler, in his job as a theater  projectionist, splices pornographic one-frame shots into the films he runs.  Watch Fight Club closely--there are two places where a fleeting shot  appears, once about 15 minutes into the film, another at the very end.

On blu-ray  you see even more clearly what the director wanted to portray.  The 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer is a huge improvement from the dvd especially when it comes to overall clarity and color depth.  The audio is impeccable.  At times you can hear a pin drop and the expected explosions are so realistic you will be dumbfounded.  And all inbetween brings the film to a bigger reality.Fans rejoice.  Finally FIGHT CLUB can be seen in all its glory.  The impressive cast led by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter is astounding and the lead three give performances so creative, so unique and so intense that they rival the best in their careers.  The same is true for director David Fincher - this is truly his masterpiece.I highly recommend this movie in any form but particularly on the superb blu-ray.  This film is so well done it is in no way dated.

It's underrated because I don't think major critics have always given this one a great recommendation, as it deserves such.  I've discovered that, in most cases, if Brad Pitt is in a film then it is probably a good movie.  This one is in many ways.  However, I must also say that it is fully overrated in that those who really champion this film give it a lot more credit than it actually deserves, probably because of how \"cool\" the story goes with them.There are quite a few fight scenes and they are genuinely authentic fighting scenes.  As such, I don't think someone under 18 years of age should watch this movie.The actual content of the film, however, could not be more well developed.  If you've seen 12 Monkeys then I must tell you that some of the idea in this film is very similar to that one, and while I don't think this movie is as intelligent as that, it is indeed a well designed idea altogether.One thing is certain.  If you have no idea what this film is about I can tell you that figuring out what is actually going on is not very easy.  A truly detached movie watcher can probably figure it out and yet still be fully entertained by it.  If you get sunk into the movie, though, you will be well into it before you understand what's happening, and the epiphany delivered is absolutely the tops.  A genuine work of art.Don't be deceived by the title to this film.  It's a far deeper idea than it would appear on the surface, and it's far more rewarding than most films could ever be.It's a five star film.

The film tells the rather unsettling story of an insomnia stricken man, played by Edward Norton. His life changed one day when he meets a mysterious soap maker named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and, after his apartment room is blown up along with all of his belongings and the little that remains of his personal life, they became inspired to co-create a seedy underground club in which men are invited to attend and to pummel on each other to their heart's content as a form of physical therapy as well as an advanced form of personal male-bonding. Things get complex when a female drifter named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who inadvertently gets involved in the mentally deteriorated world that these two men share. Things only get worse when Tyler decides to take the club out onto the streets and then into their homes and into the lives of more political and respected people.As technically talented as Fincher is, what I admire most about the film is how he doesn't let the visuals tell the story. I know that a lot of moviegoers hate narration, but trust me when I say that it is put to good use here. The sarcastic, bitter, angry voice of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film. Is the film a satire? I'd go onto say that it is as much a satire as South Park is. So then why the slick visuals? Why the sly, cool tone? Why the clever dialogue? Well, to me it all seemed very forced and over-the-top. Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film knows this. You can tell in the sarcastic narration. I think that people may likely forget that it is Edward Norton's character who is doing the narration and so therefor we're watching the story unfold from the perspective of someone who is obviously crazy. Every person in this film is crazy in one way or another. Much like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Fight Club shows a world devoid of any sort of normal thoughts of any kind, whether independent or not. What makes the film so bizarre is the fact the thoughts of the main character make sense in the sense that they have rationale to them. However, this is also how the film's humor comes through. The physical appearance of the main character slowly grows worse and worse while the characters around his grow more self-aware, more open-minded, and more like he was at one time. What makes this so funny is the fact that acts and methods these characters use to make themselves happier are so completely irrational and ridiculous that only a fool could ever take it seriously. Not to ruin the plot, but when it comes to illegal acts of vandalism involving public property being destroyed, there comes a point where politics don't seem so important in retrospect since we live in such an interesting and advanced time in the world today.Looking at this film ten years later, it still has just as much power as it did in 1999 or 2000 or whenever it was when people decided to start watching it. As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent. His films often hold an incredible amount of visual energy, and Fight Club is no different. The performances are excellent. Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter. As for Brad Pitt, he does exactly what the role requires from him and kudos to his for being such a good sport for being in this film. I definitely wouldn't call this his best performance. He is required to act in a sub-conscious way that feels full of self-deprecation, and this shouldn't be all that hard for any good actor as long as they are a good sport and they aren't afraid of looking stupid. I prefer his roles in films like 12 Monkeys in which he plays much more deeply troubling and complicated characters. The music in this film works equally as well. It's very dirty, industrial, and overbearing, much like the film itself. However, it is, at times, heavy to the point of absurdity, so it also helps with the humor of the film too. The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it. It's full of blood and guts from beginning to end, though it doesn't exactly have a high bodycount. It's often very ugly to look at, which I don't mind except when it gets to the point where it makes the film feel a little too dirty in that way that makes you want to shower. This is also a very very homoerotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other. Their mannerisms, as well as their quick little quirks and playful flirtations, get pretty weird after a while. It's about as homoerotic a film as Interview With the Vampire. I can't say that I'm anywhere near as infatuated with it as I was when I was in high school, where any film that tried new things seemed revolutionary and brilliant, and just as well, this film makes it very difficult to take Brad Pitt seriously in most of his other films. None of these things where what I originally loved about this film, however, and the film itself still works great as a comedy. The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done. The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.So overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film. It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore. Would I recommend it to everyone? Definitely not. I will say that it's most worthwhile audience would be people who are interested in films about insanity. It's one of the best ones you'll find, or at least one of the best ones that was released in the past couple of decades. The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho. These people seem to feel that these two films contain deep philosophical messages about the nature of humanity, but they definitely don't. Sure, there's a lot going on in both of these films, and the characters may have a fascinating level of detail to them, but that does not mean that these films don't offer more than good entertainment and some ideas to think about. I don't think the characters in Fight Club should be taken seriously and I'm astounded that anyone even could take them seriously. It's like saying that Sonny in Dog Day Afternoon was right to rob the bank and that the police were all wrong. Both sides made mistakes and both sides learned things, but that doesn't change the finale of the film. If you're going to watch Fight Club, please don't try to watch it with an open-mind about the characters and the things that they say. Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity. I'm sure that the film will have the desired effect on you.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the direct?", "id": "80df36f973d29d01a7cd113d962f6ec9", "answers": [{"text": "Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, {"context": "This is a film that was completely mismarketed. This is not a film, as the previews and original teaser suggested, about pure male testosterone being manifested in basement brawls. It is not a mindless-violence, action-hero flick used solely as a vehicle to show the washboard abs and chiseled man-waist of Brad Pitt. It is, actually, a film about the chaotic descent into madness and clarity by the main character. It is about the schism of personality that occurs not only with manic depressives or schizophrenics, but on a smaller scale with each and every one of us, every day, as we question our purpose, our reasons for fitting the mold when all we want to do is break free, and our intense and inward reactions to the immense pressures of culture and society.This is not a film that exploits violence simply for the entertainment factor. It's a deeply funny, deeply thought film about the roots of violence, and the possible need for violence amongst the displaced men of today's culture. Suckled on advertising and inhabiting the soft life of corporations, how can the past hunters of society not be driven to make violence-or at least something that feels powerful-with their hands? It taps into the rage men feel at being promised and denied a spot as a demi-god in the culture simply because of their gender, and also taps into the hopelessness the younger generation feels at having been raised without our fathers.Helena Bonham Carter is really the only woman in the film, but having a mostly male cast does not hurt this film for an intelligent female audience. So many of its components speak more directly to a generational frustration than any male-female dilemma, and the insights on the current male situation through this film are thought provoking regardless of gender.I'm eternally glad I let myself be argued into seeing what I had already dismissed as a gratuitous smash-fest featuring the less-than-desirable Pitt (I call him \"Pockmark\"), as it now holds strong at #2 on my list of favorite movies of all time.

Two horribly failed attempts to animate the story (both failed so miserably the funding was pulled before they could be completed) proved the work was too big, too complicated and too adored by readers to be translated less than perfectly. On top of that Tolkien created this thick, complex world and languages that could not easily be shown or translated to the screen.But Peter Jackson did it.From the grand opening shots of the Shire, to the showdown with the Balrog, this is a moving, stirring, emotional spectacle. A masterpiece.The episodic first installment covers the handing over of the one ring from Hobbit Bilbo to nephew Frodo, neither of whom know the rings powers or origin. A dark force, Sauron, who forged the ring of power to control the lords and kings of Man, Elves and Dwarves. Existing only as a powerful spirit, a great fiery eye, Sauron searches tirelessly for the ring that can bring him back to form and power. When Wizard Gandalf figures out the nature of the ring (in an abiding Duh! moment) he hurries Frodo - who is quickly joined by fellow hobbits Merry, Pippin and loyal servant Samwise - away from the shire so that Gandalf can figure what the enemy is up to, plot a course of action and find a way for Frodo to be released of his task of baring the desperately hunted ring of power. He fails, being capture by turned-evil wizard Saruman and does not meet up with Frodo at the designated place and time.Frodo and friends being pursued by Dark Riders, the kings of men possessed by the one ring and now Ring Wraiths, is taken under wing by Stryder, a mysterious Vagabond who seems to know more about Frodo that Frodo.The journey takes them to Rivendell, one of home of the elves, and master Elrod. A council of Man, Wizard, Dwarf and Hobbit is convened and nine go forward to destroy the ring, by carrying it into the stronghold of Sauron and casting it into the fire from which it was forged.The Quest take Frodo and Company to the top of a mountain nearly brought down by Saruman to the mines of Moria, where the entire population of Dwarfs mining it have been slaughtered and the Fellowship must face an impress army of thousands of orcs, a cave troll and the satan-like Balrog.In the end the story concludes by not solving anything, but leaving us open for the next film.The ride is breathtaking, the sets are amazing, the costumes, acting, directing, music and sound are all dead on perfect. Peter Jackson never lets the camera stop moving and knows how to film action in a personal and involving way that is rarely seen. This grand operatic quest is on a scale never before seen and the DVD and Dolby or DTS sound are brilliant.

Thankfully these films are all shot back to back so we're guaranteed the same cast throughout the trilogy.Especially Aragorn, Legolas, Boromir and Gandalf, who bring these roles to life in such passionate detail.

I am baffled.How could this massive amount of visual material be created and put togetherin such a comparably short time? How could it all be coordinated andharmonized into such a consistent whole? How could the genuine feeling ofculture and history of a whole world be created in that short time? Itdoesn't add up. It's not natural. And it doesn't matter that the film crewin the extra documentary material on the DVDs tell us how dedicated and hardthey worked; it still doesn't add up. I am telling you, it ain't natural.There must have been some paranormal or magical forces involved in themaking, or perhaps Tolkien's spirit coordinated the work.How could they find so many actors that fit so perfectly into the roles, andacted as if they actually were their role characters and not hired actors?And all integrated with the visual environments and special effects work.Incomprehensible. Supermundane forces must have played a part .I can see some minor weak points in the films, but on the whole they standas a world on its own, above the reach of criticism. As with the books myfavorite is The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers feels a little liketransportation (I thought the weakest part here was the Ent. He feltunconvincing and childish with his too obvious human characteristics andexpressions, like an illustration from a children's book. And some ofthe orcs look a little too caricaturish with their long noses.)When reading the books I imagine characters and environments a littledifferently, more mundane down to earth, with ordinary persons put inextraordinary situations, so that there becomes a strong contrast. Forexample, the Shire countryside being mellow in tone, to contrast more withthe magic glimmering of the Elven world. In the film, all the maincharacters glow with charisma, and everything is really intense, from colorsto acting. But that is alright. It is still very well done. And there is nodefinite way, because everyone who reads the books has his or her personalvision.The Return of the King has grown upon me, and it is just as great as thefirst film, but in a different way; it has grand beauty within the contextof war. Oooh, and that green dress Arwen is wearing at the wedding! A colorfrom beyond this world!The Extended Editions have many great scenes added, especially in The Returnof the King. Who can forget the episode with Gandalf and Pipin atop MinasTirith, by the white tree, talking of days gone past? Or the Mouth ofSauron!?The extra material is very generous. Sometimes a little too generous,because every magic trick is revealed.  But if you are yourself an artist,or work with film, it is indispensible information, and very enjoyable towatch.Those involved in the films also tell us how difficult it was to break upwhen it was all over.

The whole imagery and setting is beautiful in every way.  As for the special effects, you can't criticize it because the visual images are all very convincing and I was very impressed by how they made the Hobbitts look the right size.  Although I have read only the first few pages of the book, I was a little worried that the normal sized actors would be too big.  The special affects, however, made the hobbitts look as small as they are supposed to.  It looks very real.  Of course what matters in this movie is not necessarily the images, but really the whole mood, feeling, and excitement of the movie.  Even one who hasn't read the books can sense the evil of the One Ring and how it influences the characters and heroes.  Any person who possesses or wears the Ring is driven mad by its powers and even the good are corrupted by the tempting powers of invisibility and to control others.  Elijah Wood deserves a great deal of credit for how well he plays the hero Frodo, who is given the burden of the Ring and experiences the dark images of the Ring's evil powers.  It is very dark and dramatic the way it is all done.  The subtleness and tensity is all too great and never been exceeded in any other movie I've seen(although &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; comes close).  All of the actors do deserve praise for how well they've done with Tolkien's characters.  Some favorite scenes of mine include the flight to the ford to escape the dark rider, the fight on the tower where Frodo gets stabbed, the setting of Lothlorien with the mystical Queen Galadrial, the meeting of Arogorn and Arwnen, and the ending scenes known as the Breaking of the Fellowship.  The music itself is very grand as Howard Shore's score helps add to the enchantment and magic of the movie; not to mention the Celtic &quot;goddess&quot;, Enya, whose music has enchanted many around the world(she's my all-time favorite singer!).For some reason I have felt like comparing this movie to the Harry Potter film, probably because of the cruel critics who have.  Well, I do find both &quot;Fellowship&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; to be both magical in every way, with setting, story, characters, and mood.  To all complainers who complained about &quot;Harry Potter&quot; being too scary, &quot;Fellowship&quot; is mega-scary and many times more scary than &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  My nine year old brother handled this movie very well, but I don't think my five year old sister would have been able to handle it.  &quot;Fellowship&quot; is also much long, as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; quickly moves from scene to scene, but &quot;Fellowship&quot; stays longer with certain scenes.  At first I couldn't decide which I liked more, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;Fellowship&quot;, but I did find &quot;Fellowship&quot; to be more lively and enchanting.  For that reason, I like &quot;Fellowship&quot; a bit more, but even so, there is still plenty of room for &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  I will, on the other hand, have to read the whole book to see how well the movie follows along.  I  do expect both &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Fellowship&quot; to recieve many Oscar nominations and surely some winners.  If not, there will be great outrage.

I couldn't imagine anyone else playing either of the two wizards than McClellan and Lee; each was given the right character to do and each did his part superbly.  Frodo Baggins spent a little too much time looking wide eyed and misty, but his eyes are so beautiful, I decided I didn't care!  I did find the use of the CGI characters a little repetitious.  Since Summers' The Mummy first brought creepy crawlies out in force through CGI everyone seems to use the same types of renderings and mannerisms.

It was, indeed, delightfully fanciful.  I was especially enamored, too, with the lands of the two groups of elves.  Their architecture, costume, and personal grace were arresting.  When Bilbo Baggins chose to live among them to write his book, I thought I could see retiring there to a life of contemplation and reading myself!

It transfers to the small screen without difficulty.  There are points when the dialogue seems a little forced, possibly because the smaller screen makes the human figures stand out more importantly from their background.  It might also be due to the fact that it was my second viewing of the film, so I already knew what was going to be said, anticipation making it seem more forced.All in all the film is a masterpiece.

If he truly wanted to cash in, he could have just gone to Australia or England, found a sound stage and done the entire trilogy using sound stages and CGI. He didn't though.  He filmed the majority of the films on locations in his homeland, New Zealand, and many crews took many months recreating Middle Earth.

And while this may not be the best movie of all time, one could argue from the two behind-the-scenes DVDs, that it is, indeed, the greatest piece of filmmaking ever.Hundreds have spoken already of the merits of the movie simply as the realization of Tolkien's writings. But the true power of this extended edition is not so much the first two DVDs' added thirty minutes of scenes unseen in the theatrical release (that do flesh out the story even further), but the last two discs. Simply said, they are the finest \"making of\" pieces I have ever watched.Everything a film buff would want to know can be found on the final two DVDs. The gift of this extended version provides us with insights into virtually every aspect of the movie. You get background on Tolkien himself,  the genesis of the film project, script insights, actor commentaries, hours of brilliant visual and sound effects background info, staggering props work... well, the list goes on and on. Always astonishing, these two DVDs are simply worth the cost of this set apart from the movie itself.So complete is this background that one almost feels qualified to helm an epic like this. I thought I knew quite a bit about moviemaking, but this set put it all into perspective, and to be honest, my jaw was still on the floor when these two DVDs ran their course. How this movie didn't cost close to a billion dollars to make is beyond me, and I believe, will be beyond anyone who sees this set.For those that have seen \"Fellowship\", this 4-disc set will do something that few other sets of this type will do: you will get that tingle down your back and that pull in your chest that will make a second viewing of the movie itself pure myrrh. Think of the movie as a sumptuous meal accentuated by the background discs - the perfectly matching wines. Everything is enhanced; the sum is better than the parts.As for the movie on the first two DVDs, the transfer is beautiful. \"Attack of the Clones\" boasts of being a full digital to digital transfer, but \"Fellowship of the Ring\" is easily its equal, though simply film to digital. A splendid job.  Thankfully, with this many hours of film and background to wade through, the navigation design for the DVDs is excellent - clear, simple, and obvious. Navigation designers can take a tip from the work here - \"K.I.S.S.\"Lastly, this is the best sounding movie transfer I have ever heard. The DVDs are packed with sound options and even a casual listener can tell the difference. Mark this one as THE test DVD for your latest sound system.In short, this is a mind-boggling package. If you wish to own the first film in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, it would be foolish to buy any lesser DVD transfer out there. And at this price for the extended edition, purchasing anything less would not only be foolish, but criminal, too.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the documentary?", "id": "516fd61331ee6cacdb303d14eff29c09", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "First of all, I loved \"The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring\" and I am egarly anticipating the await of \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return Of The King\". You all know the story: Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is a young Hobbit from the Shire in Middle-earth who is sought out to destroy the One Ring, created by Sauron, the Dark Lord, by tossing it into the cracks of Mount Doom. If the Ring is not destroyed, then Sauron will have complete power throughout Middle-earth, and destroy everything that is good and turn it to evil. And with the help of eight other companions (including Gandalf the wizard, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, two Men called Boromir and Strider, and three of Frodo's Hobbit friends), Frodo begins the quest of a lifetime to reach Mount Doom before it is too late.After finally just finishing \"The Fellowship\" book, I've realized that they left out a lot of it in the film. But that doesn't really hurt the film, because at least when people see the film who have already read the book, it will be more surprising to them. Peter Jackson did an incredible directing job...I don't think any other director could have pulled this off so well. The acting by the entire cast is truly outstanding, especially by the lead. Elijah Wood is finally getting the credit and recognization he deserves! The special effects just simply leave you in total awe...there's no other word to describe them.Now onto the DVD. I must say that this first edition DVD is lacking somewhat, so I'm very glad New Line Cinemas is already planning the release of a Platinum Series edition, which will surely be much better than this. This DVD includes an exclusive preview and behind-the-scenes look at \"The Two Towers\", featurettes, revealing of secrets behind the film, theatrical trailers, Enya's \"May It Be\" music video, and more.

Luckily, the One Ring of Power, lost for over three thousand years, has come into the hands of a humble, young hobbit named Frodo Baggins. With the benign wizard Gandalf the Grey to instruct him, Frodo and his best friend, Samwise Gamgee, travel with two other hobbit companions to the woodland realm of the elves, led by a mysterious ranger called Strider. Once there, the band of heroes is joined by Legolas the Elf, a nobleman named Boromir, and Gimli the dwarf, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. It is the quest of the Fellowship to take the evil Ring to the fires of Mount Doom, in the land of Mordor, to destroy it. It is a perilous journey, however. Along the way, they must face monstrous creatures such as Orcs, Ringwraiths, Cave Trolls, Goblins, and all manner of other horrors. But, they will also discover the distant majesties of their world, the fascinating cultures, beautiful beings, and awe inspiring landscapes.  They must always remain on guard though, because there are less obvious dangers lurking as well. The Dark Lord Sauron's demonic eye is ever watchful, his spies seek out the hobbits in search of the One Ring, and the ring itself is the greatest danger of all. Its wicked power seeks to envelop all who are near and lead them to certain doom.Based on the renowned books by author J. R. R. Tolkien, \"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" is only the first in a three-part fantasy epic that is mindblowing to say the least! Director Peter Jackson, surprisingly coming from a no-budget splatter film background, brings the world of Middle Earth to fantastic and astonishing reality! Intense detail in every aspect of the filmmaking process has resulted in a trilogy like no other. It is pointless to single out performances here, for every cast member is perfection. The visual effects are flawless, the music is inspiring, and the settings are incomparable. The great attention to detail results in a medieval world that, fantastic as it is, seems 100% real. The languages are real, the various cultures are in depth, and at the heart of it all is the message that no creature is so small that it is insignificant or incapable of making a difference. This is filmmaking at its finest. Can any one film of the trilogy stand alone as a viewing experience? Yes and no. The films are each fantastic and plenty lengthy, though there is never a dull moment, but they are unquestionably all one single story. They must ALL be seen consecutively and in order (though you don't have to watch them all in one day). This Widescreen, 2-disc edition of the DVD presents the film as it was released in theaters, with a beautiful widescreen format and a fine collection of extras that include: 3 featurettes on the making of the film, 15 short web-featurettes, theatrical trailers and TV spots, a music video by Enya, a preview of the second film in the trilogy (Two Towers) and its video game, and, believe it or not, a preview of the extended edition of the DVD. That's right, some time after the release of this theatrical edition, extended editions of the already lengthy films were released on DVD. Those must be REALLY long, and they probably have some great extras too; maybe the audio commentaries or production art we don't get here. Regardless, even Peter Jackson refers to the theatrical releases as the \"preferred versions.\" So, make your choice. You might even feel like owning both versions. Any way you go, you can't lose. Fantastic films!In the past, there have been animated versions of the Lord of the Rings and the preceding tale by J. R. R. Tolkien, \"The Hobbit.\" You may want to discover these for yourself. I can't wholeheartedly recommend them, as I haven't seen them since childhood, and I recall the animation being a bit weak to say the least. Still, it's been a long time, but don't expect them to come anywhere near these versions. Also recommended for \"Lord of the Rings\" fans: The Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend, The Last Unicorn, The Princess Bride, The Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, Dragonslayer, Merlin, the Harry Potter series, the Star Wars saga (still my favorite film series, but I'm a longtime fan), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Willow, Clash of the Titans, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and I'm SURE I'm forgetting many more. Also, check out a much younger Elijah Wood in \"The Adventures of Huck Finn,\" another of my all-time favorite films, and pick up Peter Jackson's \"King Kong,\" another extraordinary achievement!

In every essence of this, he stayed true to Tolkien's epic visions of fantasy grandeur.The cast was portrayed perfectly.  There could have been no better an Aragorn than Viggo Mortensen, none as passionate to play Frodo than Elijah Wood.

The elves were made up perfectly-even Galadriel, whose portrayal by Cate Blanchet I was not very fond of.  I enjoyed the hobbits' role as the comedic effect-they did it well.  And Gandalf.  Not enough can be said about Gandalf.  Ian McKellen's role as the wonderful wizard was better than perfect-Gandalf is one of those roles where you can either do it well, or make a complete fool of yourself.  McKellen was definitely the former.The special features on this DVD were something worth mentioning, too.

The extras on disc two are interesting and the previews for the extended version and TTT accomplish their purpose extreemly well.***original review below.***First the bad.The movie CHOPS 20% of the book -in one big chunk- (muttering a chapter title doesn't count!). The story of how Merry and Pippin become involved is cut and CHANGED. The old forest and the Barrow Wights are also missing. Some of Tolkien's best descriptions are found in the forest scenes (gnarly, old, and aware trees; gloom and darkness; spiders and other creatures lurking! The Galadriel scene is BAD. And there are two things wrong with Moria. 1. The cave troll scene is too long and it should have some texture on its skin (of fur). 2. I would have liked to see a bit more of Moria. The special effects when the ring is worn are overdone. One too many sweeping helicopter shots of the river. Finally, the scene where Sam goes into the river at the end was done all wrong!***Now for the GOOD***The history of the ring is told very well. Many scenes show a great deal of very good creativity. The Shire scenes are wonderful. Good humor (except in Rivendell, and taht the \"conspiracy unmasked\" was cut out). ***The reactions of Gandalf and especially Boromir to being near the ring really helps display the evil power of the ring. Their acting (and the direction in these scenes) is PERFECT!*** The wraiths were also done very well.The special effects and music are teriffic. The color and \"tone\" of the river and the huge statues at the end are especially tastefully done. Shrinking the Hobbits was just plain unbelieveable when they were running around several other characters. The scene at Orthanc was visually spectacular and the duel was creatively and tastefully done.Substituting Arwen for Glorfindel neatens things. The moria scenes (except for the above criticisms), are superb -especially when Gandalf \"defeats\" the balrog.[All of the smaller plots of the book could have been done except it would have confused and blurred things for the unread, and the movie would have been five hours long!

His crew members also did their jobs right, especially the visual effects people -led by \"Star Trek: Insurrection\"'s Jim Rygiel, and Richard Taylor -who carry out their task without flooding the movie with so many effects; and Howard Shore who created his best score ever, with a little help of Enya.It would be ridiculous for me to give a summary of a story which is so wildly popular.

This initial dvd offering features two discs -- one for the film itself (as released in theaters) and another for special features. ( A four-dvd edition will be released in November 2002.)The film is a remarkable and faithful adaptation of the first volume of Tolkien's trilogy. Jackson masterfully carries this literary masterpiece into the 21st century with breathtaking sets, gorgeous costumes, sumptuous music, gloriously eye-popping special effects, and a touching attention to detail that evokes history-laden cultures. One does miss Tom Bombadil, and wonder why screenwriters decided to make Frodo ignorant of Bilbo's imminent departure from the Shire for example, but mostly one can understand the cinematic justification for changes that were made and just bathe in this beautiful film -- whether or not you are a devotee of JRR. If you are hesitant to see this film for fear of being disappointed -- race out and get it now. You will NOT be disappointed. From the introductory voiceover to a beautifully realized Hobbiton, the opening is mesmerizing and the film just keeps getting better, in some ways revealing Tolkien's rich and complex world even more clearly than the books. The characters are well-realized and the cast is exquisite. You can tell that the people who worked on this adaptation cared about the books even more than they cared about the bottom dollar, and I hope the awards start rolling in for Jackson, his right-hand man Richard Taylor and their talented cast and crew.The special features include: three documentary features -- \"Welcome to Middle Earth\" (a publisher's in-store feature, 17 minutes), \"Quest for the Ring\" (originally aired on Fox TV, 22 minutes), and \"A Passage to Middle Earth\" (originally seen on the Sci Fi Channel, 40 minutes); fifteen featurettes about the cultures and locations depicted in the film; two teasers, a trailer and six tv spots; a preview of the extended dvd edition due out November 12, 2002; a preview of Entertainment Arts' video game, \"The Two Towers\"; an 11-minute behind-the-scenes preview of the film, \"The Two Towers\"; and an Enya video. There is also a coupon and rebate booklet for such varied items as sword replicas, jewelry, posters, etc.\"Welcome to Middle Earth\" features a charming introduction to Robert Unwyn who, as a boy, originally reviewed The Hobbit for his publisher father and, fortunately for us all, gave the manuscript a thumbs-up with the comment \"should appeal to all children between the ages of 5 and 9\". Years later, as a publisher himself, he received the manuscript for The Lord of the Rings (originally presented as a single volume) and wrote to his father for advice, telling him that he thought the book was wonderful but would probably lose a thousand pounds; his father replied \"IF you believe this to be a work of genius, THEN you may lose the thousand pounds\" -- and off they went! This 17-minute feature also shows Tolkien's Oxford hall and home, describes two Houghton-Mifflin companion volumes and is really a wonderful treat for fans. The three features include interviews with Peter Jackson, WETA Workshop's Richard Taylor, artists Alan Lee and John Howe, and actors Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Billy Boyd, Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler and Sean Astin. The preview promises that \"The Two Towers\" will be amazing and one gets the impression that this team, as the fellowship members go their separate ways and new characters are introduced (including Gollum!), truly understand the story they are bringing to life, and will dazzle us all again soon.There is something to be said for waiting until November and getting the four-dvd special edition, which will include 30 extra minutes of film (particularly in Hobbiton and concerning Gimli's enchantment with Galadriel).

So in the year 2000 X Men was released in theaters. Now I do enjoy all 3 movies cause I can get some entertainment out of The Last Stand but I have my problems with it & it's not as good as the 1st X Men movies. But getting to this review X Men was directed by Bryan Singer who directed the sequel to this movie as well as Apt Pupil The Usual Suspects & unfortantly Superman Returns. It stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, James Mardsen as Cyclops, Famke Janseen as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin as Rouge, Rebecca Romjn as Mystique & Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The story is you start off in 1944 in Poland a boy named Eric Lehnsher who is seperated from his parents & they are being taken off to a gas chamber. This scene imo is better than X Men First Class where the guards are holding him back from getting to his parents & his mutant powers are triggered & he bends a metal gate the effects are so much better than those Secret World Of Alex Mack effects in First Class. So Eric goes on to become Magneto. Then you get to 50 years later you're introduced to this girl nmaed Marie who kiss her Boyfriend & she has mutant powers that that can take away peoples life force. It nearly kills her Boyfriend & he was put in a coma for 3 weeks Marie runs away from home & goes by the name of Rouge. She ends up in northern Alberta Cnaada she sees this cage fight going on where Wolverine is kicking a  s  s. Some guys start hounding Wolverine & pulls his claws out & The Bar Tender pulls a Shot Gun out on him Wolverine cuts it in 2. While he is leaving he discovers Rouge hiding in the back of his truck. He lets her go along. They are attacked by Sabertooth who works for Magneto but they are saved by Cycolps & Storm. Then you haved this Senator named Robert Kelly who wants to start up a Mutant Regerstration Program during the hearings he debates Jean Grey meanwhile you have Professor Xavier spot his old friend Eric & as you should know they have different view points Xavier wants peace with Mutants & Humans while Magneto wants a war. Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen had a good back & forth with each other in these movies. I have heard people say Professor X & Magneto in X Men First Class was better I'm sorry but James McAvoy is a bad actor & Michael Fassbender is an overrated actor & that movie is a crime compared to what was told in the animated series. Then you get to the mansion where Wolverine comes to & tries to escape he looks for Rouge but meets Professor Xavier he is told that this is a school for mutants & how he can help him figure out his past. Meanwhile Magneto hatches this plot to capture Senator Kelly & another of Magneto's hench men Toad is flying the helicopter & Mystique a shape shifter turns into 1 of Senator Kelly's aid's. Magneto infects him with Mutant powers. He escapes & tells The X Men what Magneto is up to. 1 night Rouge hears noises coming from Wolverine's room she goes to check on him he accidently sticks his claws in her & she starts to absorb his power. Mystique transforms into this student named Bobby who is a love interest of Rouge's & tells her that everyone is mad at her & she should leave. Mystique sets up Cerebro the supercomputer of Professor X uses to kill him. Rouge is tracked down to a train station. The Professor has Cyclops & Storm go to get her he has Wolverine stay he fells that Magneto is trying to but Wolverine takes Cyclops motorcycle & goes to get her anyway. While he talks to Rouge Magneto shows up takes Rouge the police try to stop Magneto but that doesn't work out for them. When Magneto turns the cops weapons on them Xavier uses his powers to save them. They figure out why Magneto took Rouge cause with her he can infect many people. Cause the machine he used on Senator Kelly nearly killed him. When The Professor used Cerbro it nearly kills him leaving him in a coma. You have the team suit up & go after Magneto. There is  this summit going on with all these World Leaders & Magneto wants to inffect them. The X Men fight off Mystique & Toad. Mystique transforms into Wolverine her & Wolverine have a pretty good fight. Meanwhile Storm,  Jean Grey & Cyclops have their troubles with Toad. Toad also spits some kind of slime into Jean Grey's face. Storm defeats & of course she has this stupid line. Then you have this scene where Mystique turns into Storm & she tells Wolverine they need to regroup but Wolverine knows it's not Storm by her scent & he stabs her in the stomach. Then you have scene that I felt this is what animated series Wolverine would say when Cyclops & Storm think Wolverine is Mystique & Cyclops wants him to prove it Wolverine says \"You're ad  i  c  k.\" They get to the top of The Statue Of Liberty where Magneto traps them he also uses his powers to to move Wolverine's arms to his chest. Wolverine injures himself to break free has a good fight with Sabertooth he kills Sabertooth. Storm & Jean Grey compine their powers to get Wolverine to the top of the machine where he destroy's it & saves Rouge. Magneto is defeated you have Professor X tells Wolverine that there is this abandoned Military Base in Canada that might hold some secret of his past. The group find out Mystique is still alive & she is impersonating Senator Kelly. You have a great ending where you have Magneto tells Professor X that he will eventually escape & Xavier says he will be there to stop him. Now getting to the things I didn't care for they focused on Wolverine & not the entire X Men which they do a lot in all 3 movies  mainly in the 1st & 3rd. I didn't like what they did with Robert Kelly seeing as his character got important in the animated series. But the rest you had a cast that clikced well humor that worked good directing by Bryan Singer. Patrick Stewart was did a great job. Ian McKellen was great. Hugh Jackman pulled the role of Wolverine off so well. James Mardsen did a pretty good job. Famke Janseen was good. Halle Berry was decent. Anna Paquin was good. Rebecca Romjin was decent. Tyler Mane was ok. There isn't much more to say if you haven't seen X Men go see it along with the much better sequel X2.

The movie itself features great performances from the whole cast inlcluding the late Oliver Reed who died in Italy right as this was being finished.  The fictional story of the evil emporer Commodus and his betrayel of his top general is a interesting one.  In real life Rome had just had a number of great emporers : Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian and then Marcus Aurelius who was Commodus's father. All of these men had fought on the frontiers and made the empire strong , they were excellent emporers and then came the degenerate partier Commodus.  He fought in the gladitioral games and spent the empires money on his desires while the frontiers were being attacked.  He was cruel and finally killed and that was a good thing for the world.  But he was in charge for many years and not a few months like in this movie.  Still the movie captures his evil nature very well as does the actor who protays him,  and it presents a story about revenge.  This is a good movie in spite of this historical misstep.

But in all honesty, about an hour into the movie, you feel as though you've been watching it much longer.  The film moves slowly and never seems to gain any real momentum.  You can fall asleep at many points in the movie, wake up, and be completely caught up in a few minutes, as I did.  The slaughter of Maximus' family doesn't quite pull at your heart like I think the director wanted it to.  I found myself more annoyed that Maximus wouldn't assume the power that Marcus was bequeathing him.That said, the extra DVD that accompanies the film is wonderful!  There are interviews, behind-the-scenes trivia, and a section of clips that ended up on the cutting room floor.  I really enjoyed watching the short segment on the costumes and special makeup required for the battle scenes.  The extra DVD has all sorts of goodies that are a DVD-owners dream!

I'm game! and both versions are on one disc, I love both versions, so thats another bonus for this set.Paramount has done a great job with these Sapphire Series, I will be reviewing the Braveheart one and the Saving Private Ryan ones when I watch them, I've sampled them, and they look fantastic, but this one here is truly outstanding.Now if you buy the triple feature sapphire series set, you get all 3 movies said above, but you won't get the extras, and I'm a completist, so I bought all 3 seperatly, but still, these 3 movies on blu ray for about $25.00 for the set is still a great deal don't get me wrong, just no extras.I don't need to say much about the movie, fans of this film know truly how great of a film this is, so my focus was on the product itself, so if you are a fan of this movie, this edition is a MUST HAVE!, I'll still keep my DVDs of it of course, but this one will see the playing time!", "qas": [{"question": "How can you describe the action?", "id": "7276853e33af2521bca9be3d89bcb5e9", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Some people don't like this movie, they say it's an overbudget action film.

It also immortalizes, above all, director Ridley Scott.Roger Ebert complains of people with short memory spans praising this film while forgetting that films like Spartacus have supposedly done this before. Well, I have a good memory, and I remember Spartacus. In fact, I kept on remembering that film while watching Gladiator, only in the context of, &quot;This is so much better than Spartacus. It goes beyond.&quot; The action is better, the visuals are better, the story is better, and the acting is better. Sorry, Kirk.Since this is an action film, the story isn't the most important element, but for an action film it is actually quite good. For one thing, I liked the disturbing under-the-surface incest element going on between Commodus and Connie Nielson. Furthermore, it was interesting to see how Crowe gained support among the gladiators until it became as if he were a general leading his army again. The plot itself needed to be there in order to fully create a sense of grandeur. With its insurrection story, the rise of the hero and his trek to the capitol of Rome, and the look at the people in power, the plot creates a sense of time-and-place necessary for an epic that couldn't exist with the visuals and action alone.The acting is among the best one can ever seen for an action film, and there is plenty of fine dramatic work pulled off by the two main actors. Russell Crowe is now one of the best &quot;new&quot; (four or five films so far) actors in film. We believe, in his glances and the ways he delivers his many great lines, that he is Maximus. He is poignant, hate-filled, and sorrowful all at once. The praise he is getting is deserved. But why isn't Phoenix being lauded just as much? He carries the film in the second-largest role just as well as Crowe. His Emperor Commodus isn't a good villain and has no real character, but Phoenix adds so many layers to him and turns him into a great antagonist that that alone makes his performance excellent. He commands attention just as Crowe does. All by himself (no help from any great dialogue or development), he creates a villain that is prissy, whining, ambitious, pathetic, and malevolent, and worthy of our hate as well as our pity. It's a wonderful transformation. To sum it up, the characters themselves aren't really developed at all- but the acting is so good that it seems they are.Now, onto the action, which, as I had hoped, is plentiful and intense. It has diversity and grandeur. All the fights were fast, hard-hitting, uncensored, and very bloody, which is what they should've been like. And every single fight sequence is unique from the others. There's the match where two men fought chained to each other, the opening war battle, Maximus vs. numerous other fighters, and the final sword duel, to name a few. This is so much more than just two half-naked men fighting with swords, which is what it could've been. The film also captures the feel and the motion of combat. Ridley Scott speeds up the film slightly during fight scenes to show the chaos and rapid reflexes necessary to survive. During the fight scenes, the camerawork is nonstop and covers the combat as one big blur to the fighters. (But we can still follow the fights themselves.)This film also stands out in my mind as one of the most visual, image-driven action films I've ever seen. Thanks to Ridley Scott, practically every scene is jammed with wonderful detail, art direction, even distinct lighting (the Collosseum orange, other parts of Rome dark blue). Just look at the wide multitude (seemingly infinite number) of battle masks, weapons, and locales. Cinematography is skillful and impressive. There are tons of memorable shots, like Maximus entering the ring with rose petals coming down on him like rain from above, Commodus' pure white battle costume (when he's being risen up on the platform he looks like a demented angel ascending to heaven), and the images used to represent Crowe's home- the gentle hand carressing the wheat reeds, the door to his house, etc. They had a surreal quality and each were bathed in their own distinct color. Excellent work, Ridley.A very impressive film. So why can't all summer movies be this good?

The only other science fiction movie that surprised me as much as this one (I was expecting little and got more than I thought I would) is \"Event horizon\".The plot is not original: a spaceship transporting a group of people crashes in a seemingly deserted planet. Soon, they discover that the planet had been previously reached by human beings, but now they're all gone. What happened? When they find a model showing them that the planet is immersed in a total eclypse every twenty-two years (and the cycle will be closing very soon again) they start to worry.Right, there are many incoherent situations and plot holes in \"Pitch black\", but there are three things that make this movie good: 1. Most of the characters are well-developed, each with his or her own singularities; when they start to die (as they will obviously do) and the troubles begin, the viewer cares for them. 2. Director David Twohy knows how to build the tension on screen, using the lights/no-lights situations; also, the visual effects of the \"natural inhabitants\" of the planets are very effeective to the audience. 3. Vin Diesel surprised me once again as an actor full of resources, even if always basing his characters on a macho figure; for an example, Caparzo (from \"Saving Private Ryan\"), Varik (from \"Boiler Room\") and Riddick may look alike, but if you think well, you'll find out that each has its own personality: Caparzo as the bearlish friend you can always count with, Varik as a tough but gentle guy, and Riddick as a mean, cool and violent outlaw.So, that is to say that \"Pitch black\" was a nice surprise, and now I want to watch \"The Riddick chronicles\". \"Pitch black\" was deservedly nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film in 2000 (lost to \"The matrix\").Grade 8.2/10", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the plot?", "id": "78cc9351893af5943903d67388a63bc7", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00003CXI0", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I've never been the kind of person that buys into hype and to be honest, I hate most big budget films, So until this weekend, I've avoided everything Harry Potter. That being said, I have never met anyone who had anything bad to say about the Potter films, so I finally decided to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised! For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen.

Rowling's novel of the same title.  A common complaint about movies that have been adapted from a book is that the movie strays too far from the book and that it makes too many changes.  This is sometimes necessary as film and novels are two different mediums and need to tell stories in different ways, but sometimes unnecessary changes are made.  Happily, this is not the case with this movie.  This movie is extremely faithful to the book, and I think the film works because of that.By now, many people probably have a good idea what Harry Potter is all about.  For those who are not in the know, here's the story for this movie.  Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is living with his aunt and his uncle because his parents died when he was an infant.  It is obvious they do not want him around as he is forced to live in the closet under the stairs and he is treated like a servant, an unwelcome servant at that.  One day owls start arriving at the house and deliver letters to Harry.  We see that the letters are from &quot;Hogwarts.&quot;  Harry's uncle keeps destroying the letters, but more come each day.  Finally he has had enough and Harry's Uncle takes the family (including Harry) to a remote island where no letters can reach them.  It is at this point that Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) finds Harry, tells him that Harry is a wizard, and that he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  See, Harry is a wizard, and is the son of a wizard.  Harry's parents were not killed in a car accident (as he had been told), but rather they were killed by the Dark Lord Voldemort, a wizard gone bad.  Harry is the boy who lived, which is why he is famous in the wizarding world.At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and makes an enemy of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Ron and Hermione are also first year students and are in Gryffindor House with Harry.  Draco is also a first year, but is in Slytherin House (Ron tells Harry that &quot;not a wizard went bad that wasn't in Slytherin&quot;).  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become good friends and get into little adventures together.  They believe that someone is trying to steal something called the Sorcerer's Stone and since no adult will believe them, they try to figure this out on their own.  At the same time, they are in the first year of school, so they have to go to their classes in magic.  A little bit of time is spent in each class so that we get a sense of the school and a sense of the magic of that Harry and friends are supposed to be learning.The movie is very faithful to the book, so most events from the book are included in this movie and while it is a fairly long movie (2 and a half hours), it moves along fast enough that you don't really feel like you've spent so much time.  One of the reasons you don't feel the time is that the acting is fantastic.  The actors are so perfect for their roles that they are almost exactly how I imagined the characters to be.  Two actors who stand out are Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape.  Rickman, especially, is a delight to watch.  This role border's on Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) as one of his great characters.  The movie also features Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) and Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick).Even though I would recommend the book to anyone, I'm not convinced the movie is for everyone.  I thought that the movie captured the events and the spirit of the book, but is missing some of the charm.  Rowling's novel just sucks you in, but at times I thought the movie was only for fans of the book.

Friends loathe interaction with him, women find him lacking, and life seems to frown on him whenever it decides to shine elsewhere, opting to instead rain on that poor tech's parade. Luckily for him, the stunningly clad devil decides that his soul has some worth and that he, for some reason, won't go to hell without her help. So, he is given seven wishes for that miserable burden he carries around somewhere inside of him, and then the nightmare proceeds.While I'd like to commit an armada of words to sinking this ship and making myself feel a little better after seeing what I saw, I find that I can't bear to entertain those thoughts. For some reason, the notion of wasting even more time with this movie, building a basis around it to explain all of its faults, seems like a nightmare. So, I'll instead pick at the scabs left from remembering just a little, showcasing my main problems within the image that it gave the viewer. Hopefully, that will caution you.First, Elliot has a little problem and, through experience, he somehow changes over the movie's vast 90 minutes, and that's supposedly buyable. He becomes confident in some rights, not as annoying toward the end of the movie, and that would have been something acceptable but, for some reason, the end of the movie reverts him yet again. It makes him the same him from the beginning, not allowing a mold to be struck. And that would have been great and all, but, in some scenes - you see the problem.Secondly, the devil is way too soft and gets played in the end. We all know its going to happen, that the end in a movie like this is going to be loathesomely happy, but the way that comes about is supposed to be interesting. In this movie, however, it doesn't find that place and instead relies on faults within the evil in evil - of all things, allowing Elliot pity in some rights. A little Catch 22 here, the escape for the soul there, and boom - its over. Yeah, whatever.Third, the wish sequences weren't all that funny. They were touted as being great, keeping one &quot;in stitches,&quot; but sitting there was more like bondage to me. I kept wondering how stupid someone could be, not learning by the second try that Evil might somehow play tricks with the wording, but apparently that doesn't dawn on the wisher. No, with your soul on the line, its trust for the devil that you decide to court. Nevermind the fact that he didn't trust the devil in the beginning. Lay a chip on the table and trust the house when it comes down to playing for stakes. Yeah.And, lastly, there was the ending's true ending. While I can understand many things that happen, the happiness in that garbage, giving him something he truly wanted, is sickening. While I can't say anything on it, really, I can say that I hoped for the process of breaking, of maiming something, and I seem to have gotten it. Unfortunately, the suffering was done by me and Elliot walked away unscathed.If you like movies of this sort, knowing the end at the beginning and think that situations like the ones described are funny, then play here. Be warned, however, that it might have an aftereffect and that you might be driven, in your madness, to try and sell your soul to make it all go away. Still, when dealing with devils like this one, there are worse things than losing your soul.

I believed it failed by doing too much, trying to tell too many stories, and pulling them all together into one in the end. I am sure if they worked on it a little longer, they could tell a better story.Best Adapted Screenplay: Give me a break, and send me to the moon!!! Once again, they could have told a better story, if they seem took their time to write it out. I was reading the information inside the DVD cover, and it look like they did work on it for some time, but there was something missing in it. So, I have to go back to the performances again. The performances did not seem real to me, it was like yeah whatever, just get off my case!!In addition, they got the idea from a TV miniseries called \"Traffik\" in the early 80's. For some reason this does not set well for me, it just seems to me not too much work is happening here. Because that is one of the first things we do in writing class, is taking stories and rewrite them, its not that hard of an task to do...Best Supporting Actor: I felt nothing from Benicio Del Toro, in his role as a Mexican Cop. There was one time in the movie that I did felt something from him, and that is in the end. I have to say that was the best part, because the ending was very moving. His performance as a whole was so so to not much. I thought Joaqun Phoenix played a stronger roll and should of got Best Supporting Actor!Best Film Editing: YAK!!! and i YAK AGAIN!!!! I have not seen soooooo many bad editing job in my life, it made movies like The Blair Witch Project, and Plan 9 From Outer Space look great! There was not much to any action in this movie to make people look good at in what they are doing. Therefore, they shot one or two bullets, and blow up a car big whip/tea doooo. I mean if they are going to give out this award for film editing, give it to somebody that Had to do Hard Work to make things look real and believable...So, I ask what was the big haa/doo with Traffic? The only thing I can think of, it was really a pro drug story more than an anti drug story. No one is clean, so don't judge me. Is what I got from this story.I watch it twice trying to find the magic behind this movie, and I could not.I did not care about how it was filmed using a dirty black and white in Mexico, and using clear clean Color in the USA. I was amazed; however, to see that the characters did change colors when they went from Mexico to the US, talking about not staying in character. LOL!!I believe what would have made the movie better, is by doing less with it.  I believe they would have had a great story by keeping it in Mexico, I think that was there strong suit in the movie.If anything this was Soderbergh Pulp Fiction! and for that I give him one star for his effort...", "qas": [{"question": "How is the thing?", "id": "851efe195e4d859d2b7ddf54343e8cdf", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00003CXP1", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I am going to try to refrain from writing a lengthy review for this film, and keep it as succint as possible, although for a film like this, the task almost seems impossible. Many reviewers have already said some things that I am going to say, and would have liked to say, but the review will go on, anyway.This is a powerful movie, in which it's main theme centers around drug abuse & addiction, and the dangerous consequences that may follow. But, the film centers on more than just drug abuse and addiction: to me it also centers on life, and how the average folk go about trying to embellish what seems like the emptiness of life. To try and enhance (and possibly) facilitate the meaning of that last sentence, think about this: many people do -- and/or try to reach for -- things that are supposed to make one's life more meaningful and complete: getting married, experiencing the birth of one's first child, going to college, becoming wealthy and/or famous, et al. In society, we are basically brought up to believe that if we follow along certain patterns (e.g. becoming wealthy, etc), we will be happy & fulfilled. One of the many things this film shows us, is that sometimes, what we are brought up to believe, can be a devastating illusion, or at least, there is a strong possibility of this.This story focuses on four main characters, and their addiction to drugs. The story is also cleverly told over the course of four seasons (three, technically), and like another reviewer pointed out a few pages back, the mood of each season correlates with the psychological and circumstantial happenings of each character (or vice versa.) The film starts with the Summer, which correlates with adolescent feelings. In this case, these four characters seemed as if they were happy (or at least we may think they are happy), and seemed to be filled with laughs, smiles and confidence in their future and dreams. In the Autumn, which represents added responsibility, and preparation for \"darker times\", things start to slowly go downhill for the gang. We can see their circumstances beginning to spiral, and their dispositions begin to follow downward as well. By, Winter (which represents \"death\" or the \"ending\"), each of these four members seem to meet the \"finality\" of their fates, to disturbing effect, to say the least. Spring, which represents birth, and fresh, new beginnings, never arrived. Heavy stuff, there.Some reviewers have complained about the camera techniques used in this film to be nothing more than flash for flash's sake, and similarly, some have said that some of the disturbing scenes found in the film were there for shock value only. I couldn't disagree more. For starters, like another reviewer has pointed out, the \"speeding up\" and \"slowing down\" techniques are supposed to correlate with the \"speeding\" or \"raciness\" of the characters' thought processes while under the influence of...well...speed (and other drugs.) I found this to be very clever and fascinating. Secondly, while there *are* indeed disturbing images in the film, I didn't necessarily find the images to be the most disturbing aspect of the film, but rather *how* these images were shot. In other words, it's more *psychologically* disturbing, than it is *graphically* disturbing, if that can be basically understood. The way this film was made alone, should not be taken lightly, and it is indeed clever and noteworthy filmmaking. You'd have to see the film for yourself to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly did wonderful and convincing jobs in their respective roles. Their performances truly helped to make the film what it was, and it wouldn't have been as complete without them. Ellen Burstyn's performance seemed to get a droves-worth of accolades, and deservedly so. Her performance was undoubtedly the most frightening, disturbing and heart-wrenching thing about this film. In moments, her character made me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether. The whole movie is powerful indeed, and the last segment (Winter) is indeed the most intense and hellish part of the movie.I watched this film with another member of my family, and by the time the \"Winter\" segment had arrived, we were *both* saying things like, \"I will *never* watch this movie again. It's a little *too* much reality.\" Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving, this film will stay in your mind long after it has ended, and many will gather their own responses as to what the movie meant to them. And, if some of you think that what happened to these characters can't happen to anyone in real-life, think again: it's *very* real, and *can* happen (and no doubt *has* happened to some in real-life.) Indeed, reality can be too much at times.Before I close out this review, let me share a brief story with you about someone who used drugs: it was documented in a program (I can't remember the name of it right now) that a female experimented with a drug, and not too long after that, her friends were quick to comment that she was becoming excessively paranoid and delusional. She was sent to a specialist who did a brain scan on her. When the doctor took a look at the scan, we the viewers (and no doubt the girl, and her mother, who happened to be alongside her) saw something *very* disturbing: there were various holes -- large holes -- throughout her brain: like the equivalent of looking at a piece of cheese after a mouse had nipped through it quite well. The result? This girl now suffers from acute bipolar/manic-depressive disorder. And you know what else? This was the result of her experimenting with a drug: after ONLY ONE TRY! That's right, this girl is now stuck with a \"psychotic disorder\" for the rest of her life, as the result of her experimenting with a drug after only *one* try. Yes, indeed, reality can be a bummer. I recommend seeing this film at least once; this goes for everyone.", "qas": [{"question": "Is this movie horror?", "id": "65ff19ecc2f8d0677e0b4177b5b65bb8", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00003CXPJ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I really like Ben Stiller which is why I was so disappointed when I saw this movie.

It was about the Germans attacking and trying to take over the Russian City of Stalingrad during World War II (WWII). I had no idea the German army had gotten that far into Russia before. But then again I didn't immerse myself in studying WW II either. I'm not sure just how much of the story line was based on fact but if most of it was true then I am totally amazed.The opening scenes were brutal and reminded me of the first half-hour of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. They showed the Russians coming off a train. Every other soldier in line was handed a rifle; the next person in line was handed the ammunition. They were told if the person in front of you gets killed, grab the rifle and go on yourself. As they crossed the river to attack the enemy and defend their homeland they were virtually massacred. If the Germans didn't kill them, their own officers were shooting them calling them cowards. One man, Vassily Zaitzev portrayed by Jude Law, came to the aid of another, Joseph Fiennes character Danilov. The way Vassily fired his weapon was certainly what made the story. He soon became a member of a sniper crew.Thanks to Danilov his name and face was in the papers. His superiors made a big thing out of him. The country needed a hero and he was to be it. It wasn't long before the Germans sent in their top sniper, Major Konig played by Ed Harris, to try to locate this now famous Russian. The movie then went back and forth between the two men and what they were doing.The film was suspenseful. It had action, combat scenes, intrigue, heroes, villains, and a little romance.

And it is pretty cool, but it's not great, and perhaps doesn't live up to its expectations. Undeniably, the music in the film is fantastic, and the soundtrack album is well worth buying. Clooney turns in a great performance in his first outing with the Brothers, and John Turturro, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman are great as well. Any fan of Homer or Sturges would be proud. However, the movie seems to fall short of what the viewer wants. It lacks the humor and the precise attention to complex and fascinating characters that we found in previous Coen Brothers films. The three bumbling escapees (Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Clarke Duncan) are the expected dim-witted good-hearted Southerners, and in the course of their odyssey to uncover the $1.2 million that Clooney stole and buried, meet a fanciful enough cast of weirdos. There's no laugh-out-loud oddballisms, no endearingly pathetic losers, no poorly thought out crime capers, to keep us really engaged. If it weren't for the music, I'd have checked out.

So many missed opportunities.  The screenplay is undermined by the all too predictable love triangle story.  Love and war tales only mixed well in 1980s network television mini-series.  PEARL HARBOR is too long and too complicated.  Additionally, and  unlike its predecessor TORA, TORA, TORA, the action scenes of PEARL HARBOR rely too heavily on CGI.  CGI is great in science fiction films, but appears as a phony video game image when representing actual aircraft.To their credit, the producers were able to borrow an aircraft carrier, fly actual and replica zero aircraft, as well as assembled flyable P-40 Warhawks and B-25 Mitchell bombers.  Unfortunately these aircraft scenes were fluffed up with computer generated images that removed all reality from aerial scenes.The ship scenes are credible, particularly the extensive recreation of the USS Oklahoma's capsizing.  If history alone carried the story this movie would have had a chance.  However, in PEARL HARBOR history played second fiddle to the romance.In PEARL HARBOR it is also annoying to find the main characters everywhere.  Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) begin their military service at Mitchell Field, Long Island.  Sorry Michael Bay, Long Island does not have any dry khaki foothills.  Here Rafe conveniently receives orders to join the Eagle Squadron and fight the Luftwaffe.  The RAF's Eagle Squadron was not an organization that was eligible for US Army Air Corps orders.  In order to participate in the Eagle Squadron -- or the Flying Tigers, for that matter -- an officer would have had to resign his commission and left the service.  Of course it was the only way to separate Rafe from his love interest Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).Rafe is shot down by a Messerschmitt and presumed dead thus freeing Evelyn to fall in love with Rafe's best friend Danny.  Danny's squadron along with Evelyn and her nurse peers find themselves shipped out to Hawaii.  Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up. Not only is Rafe alive and well, he is also an ace.  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interrupts the romantic debacle as Rafe and Danny put aside their differences take to the air against the Zeros.  After some fancy CGI flying, both pilots return to donate blood for the wounded and rush off to the anchorage to assist with the rescue effort.Rafe and Danny then volunteer to become bomber pilots and join General Doolittle in his raid on Tokyo.  Danny sacrifices his life to save Rafe and resolving the uneasiness between the two over Evelyn.  Thus Rafe is free to return to a pregnant Evelyn and both remember Danny through his son.War and romance do not mix.  ENEMY AT THE GATES was proof of that.PEARL HARBOR  boasts some great supporting actors with Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight doing a great job portraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Their roles could have been better had the movie not been crowded with a love story.A lot of work went into this movie.

I rarely watch animated shows, let alone animated movies, so I was totally unaware of how much they've changed in the last ten or fifteen years. The only reason I popped \"Shrek\" into the DVD player was because I stumbled over a website that said this film earned a place in the list of all time top ten grossing movies. I couldn't believe that claim, considering it's an animated feature, so curiosity forced my hand. All I can say after seeing this DreamWorks production is WOW! When did they start using CGI for animated features? Moreover, when did they start using CGI to such great effect? I'm not totally ignorant, by the way. I'm aware that some animated films look like what I saw in \"Shrek\" since I've seen advertisements and stills from movies like \"Toy Story,\" but I had no idea of the depth involved in every frame of the movie. Most of the films I've seen with heavy CGI usually contain one or two scenes where the effects look simply awful or fail because the script puts the plot and characters on the backburner so as to make room for the computerized images. Not so in this movie: everything we see is a computer-generated effect and the characters stand front and center.Shrek is, of course, a large green ogre with huge teeth and cone shaped ears voiced by the incomparable Mike Myers. When we first meet up with this lovable rogue he's hanging up no trespassing signs on the outskirts of his beloved swamp. Shrek likes his privacy because...well, he's an ogre and ogres need their privacy. Why would anyone want to hang around with an ogre anyway? They're ugly, crass, and mean. If the movie is any indication, they also like to bath in muck and offal. Fun. Nonetheless, Shrek soon discovers that faraway events threaten his self-imposed exile. The diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), in his evil way, issued an edict ordering the deportation of all the fairytale creatures from his domain. What a jerk! He sends the seven dwarfs, Pinocchio, a gingerbread man, and assorted other lovable creatures out into the cold, heartless world. The only place left to these poor wretches is, predictably, Shrek's swamp. The ogre opens his front door to find literally hundreds of talking animals, beasties big and small, and assorted magical creations slumming about the swamp. Enraged, Shrek embarks on a mission to Lord Farquaad's palace with the aim of obtaining the deed to his property. He takes along with him the talking Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) as his sole companion.Farquaad isn't one to cave into demands lightly, however, as Shrek and Donkey soon discover. The evil nobleman wishes to acquire a princess as his bride, and he promises to deliver the deed into Shrek's hands if the ogre will procure this woman for him. The woman in question is Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful young lady imprisoned in an imposing castle watched over by a fire-breathing dragon. Shrek and Donkey accept their mission and soon liberate Fiona from her prison, but things don't go quite right from this point forward. Shrek grows fond of the imaginative Fiona, and she of him, but their physical forms seem to prohibit any possible romantic union. After all, how can an ogre ever hope to marry a human princess? Well, in the fairytale world people aren't always as they seem. Fiona harbors an intriguing secret that would astound Shrek if he knew the truth, but Farquaad enters the picture before the ogre learns what's going on. Will Fiona marry the evil Farquaad and live unhappily ever after? Will Shrek muster up the courage necessary to rescue his beloved from the evil lord? Most importantly, will the ogre take Fiona with him back to the swamp so the two can share his cherished privacy? You ought to know the answers to these questions before the film even starts, but seeing how everything turns out is the fun part.\"Shrek\" is quite possibly the most enjoyable animated feature, television or movie, that I've ever seen. The secret to its success is difficult to summarize adequately in a mere paragraph. First, the voiceovers are wonderfully full of energy and emotion. Moreover, the animators made sure to craft the main characters so that they look like their actor counterparts, i.e. Shrek looks like Mike Myers, Donkey resembles Eddie Murphy, and so on. Second, the CGI effects are incredibly detailed, so much so that it's almost frighteningly realistic. Third, \"Shrek\" is contemporary while staying true to the old fairytale form. From the music by Smashmouth to the pop culture references to the multifaceted dialogue, modern audiences ought to find much to appreciate here. Speaking of the dialogue, I couldn't believe some of the stuff that came out of these characters' mouths. The part where Shrek points out Lord Farquaad's huge castle and says, \"You think he's trying to compensate for something?\" is absolutely hilarious. I couldn't believe he said it in what is essentially a cartoon. The movie's loaded with great double entendres that little kids won't likely understand but will keep adults engaged.I'm not even going to get into the extras on the disc except to say there's some great stuff here that takes hours to watch. My favorite supplements included a look at Myers, Diaz, Lithgow, and Murphy doing the voiceover work and the behind the scenes stuff describing how the animators performed their computerized magic.

A body is pulled from the ocean with a couple of bullet holes in the back.  Amazingly, the man is still alive.  He is treated by the ship's physician and slowly brought back to health.  The only problem is that he lost his memory.  The physician finds a metal nugget in the man that projects a bank safety deposit box number.With no clue as to who he is, the man goes to the bank and is able to get to the box with his thumbprint as his identification.  Inside the box he finds a slew of passports, currency and weapons.  Each of the passports is under different names.  He uses the one that says Jason Bourne and when he uses it for travel, the immigration computer sets off a whole bunch of alarms to some CIA operatives that very much want him dead.At a US embassy, Jason eludes his assassins (through some highly refined combat techniques and climbing skills) and asks for a ride from a lady he saw at the embassy.  She takes him, unknowingly putting herself in danger.  The two of them need to unravel Jason's mystery as to who he is, why he has the skills that he has, and why are the government agents trying to kill him.Jason and the woman (Marie) head to Paris to an address that Jason lived at.  There Jason is attacked by a hitman who has photos of both Jason and Marie that were taken back at the embassy.  Suddenly Marie realizes that she is stuck with Jason fighting unknown enemies, just to stay alive.The movie is quite different than the book of the same name but is excellent nonetheless.  Matt Damon appears well cast and all the CIA operatives are excellent as well (Julia Styles plays one of them).  The actress that plays Marie does a passable job and there seems to be a good chemistry that evolves between her and Damon.A non-stop roller coaster ride with some great car chases thrown in.

Artificial Inteligence&quot; in June when it first came out and I walked out of the theatre thinking that I had just seen a masterpiece of modern day cinema. I also thought it was going to take a lot to beat this film for best of the year in my opinion, and now it is almost the end of September and I have not seen a single film so far this year that has been better. I have seen the film twice and I actually got more out of it the second time I saw it. This is definitely a film you have to see more than once just so you can fully realize the scope of the film and all the ideas that it brings up about our future and our society. I felt so mnany emotions while watching this film that it is hard to list them all. I felt sadened, exhilarated,  touched and frustrated all at once. The film is very unsettling to watch and it is a film that can not be easily forgotten. That is what I admired most about&quot;A.I.&quot;. It makes you feel real emotions for the characters, especailly David, played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment, and Gigalo Joe, played by Jude Law who really is remarkable and perfectly cast as this character and it isn't afraid to make you feel disturbed because it is supposed to. It is supposed to put an imprint in your mind so you don't forget. I strongly admired Steven Spielberg's direction on this film. He is one of the best, if not the best, directors in the business today and he really made it seem as if Stanley Kuybrick was with him the whole time he shot this because I would say about ninety percent of this film seems like it was done by Stanley himself. The look and feel of the film are very dark for a usual Spielberg film, but it wasn't supposed to be a regular Spielberg film, it was supposed to a Stanley Kubrick/Steven Spielberg film and that is exactly what it turned out to be and it is pure brilliance.

Then I saw the next two hours.Argh...There are certain elements put forth by Plato thousands of years ago about how good plays (and by extension, movies) should be structured. A.I. broke most of these rules.1.) \"No character or action is superfluous.\" In A.I. wonderful interesting intriguing characters are introduced then immediately removed form the movie. Why offer David a nannybot then have her distroyed at a flesh fair? What happened to the scientist who tried to buy David out of slavery? Why did David's creator finally meet him, give him hope for a new family only to NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN WITHOUT EXPLANATION AS TO WHERE HE WENT?!?!??! Why show David repeat \"Please make me a real boy\" about a billion times in four interminable minutes (it was like the end of \"Poltergeist III\" after that girl died and the director had to do something to cover up her obvious not-coming-to-work-ever-again so charatcers ran around for 20 minutes yelling \"Carol Ann!\" without ANY other dialogue!)??2.) \"Brevity of time and place.\" Whereas in a quest there hero can roam about for some time and finally get to his destination, a 2000 year jump forward in time in the last twenty minues was unnecessary and added more confusion to an already murky plot.3.) \"Reasonably assume the audience knows something and can infer the rest.\" What the heck happened to the humans and why was there an Ice Age? How did the supermachines evolve? Why was it necessary to radically alter the entire world in order to have a happy ending?  Why not have a sad ending?4.) \"All conflicts must be resolved.\" Whatever happened to Joe? He was charged with murder we assume but whatever became of that? I guess the impending Ice Age made follow-through unnecessary. Shouldn't David have had the chance to confront his family (particularly his jealous brother) with the knowledge he gained from his quest? I mean, that is the point, ins't it? A hero learns something mere mortals don't, then return to make life better for norms.  The leftover brotherly angst was more distressing than anything.5.) \"Unity of plot.\" Yeah, there were like three different stories going on here, and I think I like the cynical, existentially burdened one better than the over-the-top, deus-ex-machina, We're-a-superior-being-so-step-back-enjoy-the-light-show-while-we-solve-everything, Speilberg-esque ending (Don't get me wrong: it worked in ET and Close Encounters and even in The Color Purple after a fashion, but not here).Darn.

And I don't mean that in a bad way.  It's a multi-layered world full of jungle creepers and jungle creeps, the apes themselves.  But that's about as Burton-esque as this movie gets before turning into generic summer blockbuster crapola, only this time with monkeys instead of Nazis, communists, aliens or terrorists.  It's full of ludicrous plot holes, illogical scenes that have no set-up and no pay-off, and features not one bit of terror or interest (after you've seen the cool ape-faces, that is).  You're left wondering why they bothered to make it at all.I've read a number of reviews that tell you to lower your expectations:  &quot;If you go into it expecting something dumb, you'll have a good time.&quot;  Or, if you go into it ready to have wasted money on a bad movie, you won't feel as cheated.  Isn't that damning this thing with faint praise?  After all, it cost millions to make; at least it could've been interesting.  Instead, there's no suspense, no drama and the action sequences are muddled and confusing, especially the big fight near the end.  It's barely even a Tim Burton film.Mark Wahlberg plays the human this time, crash landing after impetuously taking off after a lost chimp-o-naut and running into a freaky time-storm in space.  As if the title isn't obvious enough, he lands on a world where talking apes dominate talking people.  For some reason (never fully developed in the film), Wahlberg becomes the heaven-born savior for the raggedy, unappreciated human-folk, represented by Estella Warren (shades of Nova!) and Kris Kristofferson, who does absolutely nothing.  And there's some punk kid who mouths off and gets in the way.  Friendly apes include Helena Bonham Carter as a warm-hearted chimp and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as a disgraced gorilla general who's now her loyal servant.Unfortuntely for everyone, a vicious chimp played by Tim Roth comes calling.  Roth's out to kill all the humans for no particular reason (I think maybe he's just a lunatic... yawn), and he's aided by his giant lieutenant, a gorilla played sensitively (I'm serious) by giant actor Michael Clarke Duncan.Once Wahlberg and company escape Ape City, the story devolves into a sub-&quot;Braveheart,&quot; with hordes of people appearing out of nowhere to follow Wahlberg in a revolution he never promised.  But plot holes undermine their revolution's momentum.  Roth finds out Wahlberg's from another planet, but it doesn't figure into either the story, or his hatred for the astronaut.  Really, no one seems suprised, or even to care.  Then there's a Carter/Wahlberg/Warren/Roth love rectangle that goes nowhere, especially since Warren has little to do except look hot in leather skins.  Which she does.  Oh yes, she does indeed.I won't compare it to the original.  No deep philosophical or theological arguments or themes here.  You will find a few good performances.  Roth is especially chimp-like, and Glenn Shadix (Otho in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;) has a few brief scenes as an orangutan senator.  He's funny without being jokey, and Lisa Marie (as his trophy-chimp wife) is hilarious, too.  Paul Giamatti plays an ape slave trader, and he's got some cute moments.  And, if you don't blink, you'll see Linda Harrison, who played little hottie Nova in the original.

I would have appreciated more character background detail, but at least each one was given a distinctive personality.And, as advertised, this is a gorgeous film.  While the level of detail on the characters isn't so far advanced that you become convinced they're human, the expressiveness of the faces and body language are mind-blowing.  The characters convey the same levels of warmth and life as those in Toy Story or Monsters Inc, but without the exagerated features.  The production has such depth you forget they're just computer images, and sit back and get caught up in the action.I also appreciated the wealth of extra features on this DVD.  Let's face it, with a movie like this, there's more to wonder about how they did it, and the various commentary tracks and making-of features should satisfy all but the most demanding of fans.

Much of the movie focused on SCREAM, especially the murderous villain. A group of over-developed high school students are being stalked by the killer. There is also a take on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and a few other films but a parody of SCREAM seems to be the main focus here.Horror movies, especially those of the past 20 years or so, tend to follow a varied version of the same storyline. SCARY MOVIE reminds us that we usually know what is going to happen to our teenagers and one female lead is the main target. SCARY MOVIE takes the predictable to the absurd level.No doubt one of the funniest aspects is that the hooded villain's white face mask changes expressions to fit what is happening. He even gets invited over to party with some guys. Could it get more silly?As the years have passed, some of the references to specific movies may have faded in people's memories though since we have the constant storylines in horror/slasher films, the references are not lost.

Its mix of comedy, action and drama have rarely been matched, even today.  Now, finally, after years of waiting, American audiences can collect the stellar series, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, from the very beginning.  This show chronicles the adventures of young Buffy Summers, a high school student who is revealed as the Chosen One destined to fight the demons and vampires that plague the world. Since this was a mid-season replacement, there were only 12 episodes in this 1st season.  As always, Sarah Michelle Geller is at the top of her game in the title role, while Anthony Stewart Head is full of wry humor as Rupert Giles, her Watcher.The episodes, despite being filmed in 16mm, are sharp in both visual and sound quality.  However, the special features are a little lacking.  There's an insighful and amusing commentary by show creator, Joss Whedon, which covers the 2 part pilot for the show.  However, the Whedon interview sections only covers only half of the episodes, being a hold-over from the old 3-pack VHS set.  Also, the interview with David Boreanez (Angel) doesn't offer anything new.  Some outtakes and making of featurettes would've been nice.

For a start there are a total of 12 episodes in Season 1 compared to the 22 in all the other Buffy seasons. Secondly, there isn't a lot of character development, most of which comes later on in the splendid Season 2. Thirdly, 20th Century Fox gave Joss Whedon a limited budget on which to film 12 episodes, making most episodes rather poor in sound quality, picture quality and special effects. Despite these few let-downs the season in terms of scripts, humour and character personality is absolutely excellent. Anyway, I'll get on with my review...Season 1 starts with a brilliant two-parter season opener in the form of Welcome To The Hellmouth and The Harvest. Both episodes were first broadcast on March 10th 1997 in the US to great critical acclaim. Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her mum Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) have moved from Los Angeles to Sunnydale, California. Buffy \"fell in with the wrong crowd\" and burned down the gym. What everyone doesn't know is that Buffy was trying to kill some vampires; she found out she was to be the Slayer before coming to Sunnydale. Figuring her Slaying days are far behind her, she hopes to make a fresh start at Sunnydale High School. On her first day, she makes friends with Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) - a nerdy, unpopular, computer whizz-kid with a heart of gold and a personality to make anyone who encounters her turn to slush! She also meets Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) who is the best friend of Willow. She is also introduced to Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), who is kind to her on her first day at school. \"If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time,\" she proudly states to Buffy. It's clear that Cordelia is obssessed with being popular and loved by everyone. But after Cordelia sees Buffy hanging around with Willow and Xander, she turns on her - spreading rumors about her that last up until the end of the season. Buffy also meets up with the school librarian, Mr Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) who has secretly been sent to Sunnydale by the Watcher's Council in England to be the Watcher of a new Slayer. To Buffy, he's annoying - \"a textbook with arms.\" He knows Buffy is the Slayer, yet she won't accept this. \"Yeah, and I've both been there and done that and I'm moving on,\" she says. After Willow is snatched by a vampire, Buffy knows she must find her. Her Slayer instincts are instantly stirred and from then on, she realises being the Slayer is her duty. From then on, Buffy and the Scooby Gang (Willow/Xander/Giles) hunt the demons and vampires. Other top episodes include Witch, Teacher's Pet, The Pack, Angel, Nightmares and Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight. All the episodes have fantastic dialogue, witty one-liners and exciting storylines. This perfect combination is very hard to get right, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer manages to get it spot-on.The seasons' main story arc focuses on the vampire legend, as does the second season. Yet Seasons 3, 4, 5 and 6 didn't really focus on Big Bad's of the non-vampire variety. The Master (Mark Metcalf) is a very powerful vampire that is stuck in between Hell and Earth who is desperate to get free and rule over the world. He makes many attempts to get free in episodes such as The Harvest, Never Kill A Boy On The First Date among others. In the season opener, we meet Angel (David Boreanaz). For the first seven episodes he is know by the Scooby Gang as Mysterious Guy. He's never around through the day, has pale skin and seems to know a lot about vampires - some would say a little to much. In the episode Angel, Buffy finds out he's a vampire. The one guy she's had a crush on is a vampire. Angel is a vampire with a soul and hasn't killed a human for years since his soul was restored. Amazingly, the two start to see each other in Season 2 but for Season 1 they mainly work together with Willow, Xander and Giles. In the episode I, Robot...You Jane, we are introduced to Jenny Calendar. She is an I.T. teacher at Sunnydale High School and features in the season finale Prophecy Girl. In the fianle, the Master is freed from his prison between Hell and Earth. Buffy and the Scoobies spend the most of the season looking for where the Hellmouth is - they realise the Hellmouth is situated directly underneath the School Libary. So Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia and Ms Calendar work together in a spectacular display of teamwork and determination to save the day...OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is essential for every fan. This TV show is legendary and these 12 episodes are absolute gems for everyone to treasure. The episodes are brilliant and you can watch them over and over again.

If you have seen the original theatrical movie version of \"BtVS,\" then you have probably noticed how the words are clearly Whedon's, but the tone is not.  Given a rare opportunity for a second chance to realize his vision, the first season establishes the following points for contemplation.  You will note that they are based more on comparisons to the theatrical film than the series finale, because that ended up being the more pertinent analog:(1) The most important factor that gives the television series more depth than the movie is clearly the character of Angel (David Boreanaz), although the creation of the Scooby Gang is huge as well. But even more impressive than the fact that a vampire with a soul is in love with the Slayer is the fact that Joss Whedon holds off on this revelation until the seventh episode (\"Angel\"). For the first six episodes Angel was Mystery Guy, Stealth Guy, Cryptic Guy, and then in the first truly memorable moment of the series, Buffy learns the truth as Angel's face morphs in her bedroom. Creating these star-crossed lovers is where this television series start an operatic story arc that culminates in \"Becoming: Part II,\" the show's zenith.(2) Related to this is the Master (Mark Metcalf) story arc that defines the first season. Each subsequent season of Buffy has similarly been defined by a pair of story arcs, usually dividing the season in half: Season 2 starts with Spike & Dru and then Angelus takes over in the second half. Of course, this helps set up the thrilling season finales each year as the Master/Angelus/Mayor/Adam/Glory meets their fate. But it also means that throughout the season things are brewing and building. In other words, the order of the episodes matters.(3) As Joss Whedon has often told us, the subtext of \"BtVS\" is that High School is Hell. I was surprised that over half the episodes from the First Season dealt primarily with the horrors of going to high school, as opposed to expanding the Buffy mythos. Living up to the unreasonable expectations of parents (\"Witch\"), having a crush on a teacher (\"Teacher's Pet\"), school cliques (\"The Pack\"), meeting someone on the internet (\"I Robot, You Jane\"), facing your worst fears (\"Nightmares\"), being ignored by everybody (\"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\"), and even just trying to go out on a date (\"Never Kill a Boy On the First Date\") are dealt with in Season One.(4) The final obvious strength of the show would be the characters and the actors playing them. Willow (Allyson Hannigan) might by the all-time best Best Friend, and watching the character grow over the years has been fascinating. Poking fun at the pomposity of Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) never grows old, but I have to admit that I think Xander (Nicholas Brendon) is the [punch line] of way too many jokes. Then again, one of the show's masterstrokes is that Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), who represents everything about high school that the others hate, gets dragged into being a member of the gang. It is also clear in retrospect that Joss Whedon's knows how to use the characters and acting talent he stumbles across. Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Robia LaMorte (Jenny Calendar), and Mercedes McNab (Harmony) are all introduced in first season episodes and brought back for even greater fun in future episodes.Watching the first season episodes of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" makes it clear that the show certainly started strong. Yes, there are some efforts that could be a lot better: my groaner is \"Teacher's Pet\" although others have problems with \"Witch,\" \"I Robot, You Jane\" and \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight.\" But all of those episodes suffer in part because they are the farthest removed from the core of the Buffy mythos. But the \"Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest\" pilot, \"The Pack,\" \"Angel\" and \"Prophecy Girl\" are first-rate efforts, and that's a third of the initial season right there. However, as soon as you watch \"When She Was Bad,\" the first episode from Season Two, it is clear that the show had gotten a LOT better. So I would really give Season One 4.5 stars, which rounds up on the strength of Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance and especially her \"I don't want to die\" speech in \"Prophecy Girl.\" Killing Buffy only makes her stronger.", "qas": [{"question": "How you would describe this episode edition?", "id": "d9ef7531ed578c19feab9b6e96df3d18", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000056PMV", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Charlie's Angels is an insubstantial and entertaining dose of girl power. Although it will probably never be included in a list of 'alltime great films' it is nevertheless an enjoyable escape into a world where beautiful women kick-box their way out of danger, and manage to foil the bad guy's plans; all without smudging their makeup.Alex, Dylan and Natalie are an incredibly sexy crime-fighting trio, backed by an anonymous millionaire named Charlie. These Angels are the absolute epitome of cool. They can change from evening dress to street clothes in a matter of seconds, out-fight any number of evil henchmen, and disable a helicopter whilst hanging from the landing skids. And they manage to have a whole lot of laughs in the process; however if you're not a big fan of girlie giggles, this may start to grate after a while.The movie begins with a high-speed action sequence involving an attempted airplane hijacking which the Angels seemingly effortlessly manage to foil - this montage is perhaps emblematic of the rest of the film. The 'teamwork' motif is heavily emphasised, with the camera frequently (and occasionally annoyingly) cutting between the Angels whenever they're not in the same place at the same time. Visually stunning Matrix-style action sequences are peppered throughout the fast-paced script and these are well worth watching, even if only to marvel at how efficiently the fabulous trio of Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz dispatch with the baddies whilst wearing designer clothing and high heels.Charlie's Angels is not a movie that is likely to alter lives or provoke deep thought, but instead it can be enjoyed purely as fun escapism.

However, if you're just interested in watching a movie built around three gorgeous women, crammed with lots of action, and with it's hilarious moments? Then this is the movie for you.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are Charlie's Angels, three foxy ladies who are hired by a millionaire named Charlie to solve cases from his clients.The movie starts with an action-crammed scene involving skydiving from a 747. A hijacker is planning on blowing the plane up, and the Angels prevent this from happening.Finishing that assignment, the Angels' next mission is to infiltrate into an organisation suspected of cyber-crime. Using their superb skills in the fields of technology, disguise and martial arts, the Angels manage to gather enough evidence to build a case against the owner (Played brilliantly by Tim Curry) of the rival company of their client.As it turns out, this mission is not without dangers for anyone involved. The Angels have to put al their skills into making sure the happy ending is reached.The special effects in the movie are nothing new (The Matrix mostly), though there are some interesting shots (I for one loved the opening scene). The musical score is abosultely great (...).The real power of the movie comes from the performance and interaction of the three Angels (Diaz / Berrymore / Liu). On my opinion, particularly Cameron Diaz (sporting her ever-gorgeous smile) and Drew Berrymore (playing a seriously sexy Angel) draw attention to themselves. Tim Curry also makes for an excellent performance, but the viewer can definatly sense the chemistry between the 3 angels.Funny side performances are made by Tom Green and Matt Leblanc.The DVD is packed with lots of good extra's.

Last year we had the disappointments of such films as Rush Hour 2, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and so on and so forth, but to make up for those, in 2002 we've got Spiderman, Star Wars: Episode II and heaps of other intriguing films being released. Not only do I think this will be one of the best summer blockbusters of this year, I think it could turn out to be one of the most entertaining movies of 2002.I did expect quite a lot from this movie, but it surpassed my expectations beyond my wildest dreams. This movie is such a hard one in which to find fault! I was going to give it a slightly lower grade but then I just couldn't think of any reason not to give it the one I gave it (scroll down). Sure, the movie is cheesy in some places, but duh; it's a comic book adaptation! Of course there's going to be a bit of cheese n' corn. I must be the only person who liked the Green Goblin as a villain. To me he was perfectly menacing and his timing was right-on. I thought the costume would look horrible but it was actually OK.This movie keeps you in suspense (especially during the fair sequence) and surprised me with its genuine wit and heart. There is also one particular little part that made me completely jump out of my seat (watch out for when Willem Dafoe wakes up after being gassed!). The movie brings across some very important messages that not only superheroes should learn. I also liked it the way the movie built up Peter Parker becoming Spiderman because it put a bit of bulk on his character.The acting in Spiderman was terrific. In my opinion, all the actors were perfectly cast. Tobey Maguire is not the sort of guy you'd expect to play a superhero but he pulls it off stunningly, making a great hero and also turning Peter Parker into a likeable and memorable teen. Willem Dafoe reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson with his Green Goblin part. He has a great, evil laugh and his character (when he's not the Goblin) is sort of like a schizophrenic. The scenes where Dafoe is \"talking to himself\" are terrific and very well acted. I thought they would make me laugh but they were actually pretty creepy. Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane, providing her with a heart and personality. Dunst has exactly the right look for the movie, and has some fantastic chemistry with Maguire. I also adored Rosemary Harris in her role as Peter Parker's auntie.The special effects in this movie are terrific. I can't really pick out any key scenes where they were brilliant because I just completely forgot I was watching special effects. They are very realistic. The sound techniques are used effectively, especially in the last 20 minutes or so.One thing I would've liked is for Spiderman to maybe use some more gadgets? We pretty much got the sticky web thing and that was it. Maybe he just has that, I don't know, I've never read the comics (although I sort of want to after seeing this terrific movie). I look forward to seeing how Spidey's super-powers are improved in the next movie.Spiderman is a movie I think everyone will enjoy. It has a big heart and it is always entertaining to watch. It has terrific morals and messages and is able to mix genuine wit and comedy into an action-packed and intriguing storyline. This movie was a lot of fun and I think it'll be one of the biggest grossing movies of 2002, if not, the biggest!

There is no aspect of this movie that jumps out and makes the viewer gasp: the acting is solid, but not Oscar worthy, the special effects are more than serviceable, but not breathtaking, and the plot is entertaining, but not particularly complex.  However, when all of these elements are rolled in to one, you get a movie that is not just good, but great.  \"Spider-Man\" is a genuinely entertaining film that manages to avoid many of the pitfalls other comic book adaptations have encountered.  For example, it is my opinion that the X-Men movie took itself far too seriously, while conversely, the later Batman films weren't anywhere near serious enough.Driving this movie is the acting of its two main characters, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest, Mary Jane.  While some have argued that Maguire's performance was somewhat leaden, I thought it was perfect within the context of the movie.  Peter Parker is supposed to be withdrawn, a nerd really, and Maguire plays the role to perfection.  On the flip side, Dunst absolutely sparkles in her role.  Much has been made of her scenes wearing a tank-top in the pouring rain, and she is an undeniably beautiful woman.  However, she is also a very talented actor who conveys the full gamut of human emotion in her facial expressions.  I came into this movie not expecting much from her, and left very impressed.  The supporting cast is likewise solid, particularly William Dafoe in the role of the schizophrenic Green Goblin.  He deftly succeeds in turning what could have been a very cookie cutter villain into a surprisingly empathetic character.The story itself is relatively straightforward, and will be familiar to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the Spider-Man comics.  That said, it was no less enjoyable for its predictability.  In particular, the early scenes, in which Peter is coming to grips with his newfound powers, contain just the right mix of humor and suspense.Finally, this DVD is loaded with special features.  While deleted scenes are noticeably absent, they are more than made up for by outtakes, commentary, making of footage, music videos and DVD-ROM content.  You definitely get a lot of bang for the buck with this two-disc set.Ultimately, \"Spider-Man\" accomplishes exactly what it set out to: entertain.  It isn't pretentious, or riddled with `inside' jokes, but it also doesn't descend into slapstick.  It contains the perfect mixture of action, humor and romance, and combines very good performances from the cast with solid special effects.  In conclusion, I guess the highest praise I can offer this movie is that I can't believe I have to wait another year for the sequel to come out!Enjoy!", "qas": [{"question": "What types of film they show in the travel?", "id": "0b0bc56ca4489e70d005f6e0bc6a1469", "answers": [{"text": "directed Sam Raimi", "answer_start": 16}, {"text": "mixture of action, humor and romance", "answer_start": 2567}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JKDQ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This movie is awesomeness.

So we were delighted to receive an advance copy from an online store and Disney/PIXAR.  We've watched the film at least six times in the past four days.The movie is terrific -- one of those films that children of different ages can enjoy AND adults can watch multiple times without going insane.  This is the story of Monsters Incorporated, an energy supply company based in Monstropolis.  In this reality, energy comes in the form of children's screams, and to that end Monsters, Inc. employees emerge from closets all over the world in order to collect a few GigaHowls and keep everyone's lamps and toasters running.  The best scare team at Monsters, Inc.  is John \"Sulley\" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal).  One evening after hours, a child gets through a closet door and enters Monstropolis.  Not good, considering monsters are scared of kids and believe their touch is toxic.  Over the course of the movie Sulley and even Mike become attached to \"Boo\", risking health and careers to get her back to her home.  In the meantime, incorrigible adorable Boo is having a great time scaring all the big monsters.The film is incredibly well done, as technically flawless as earlier PIXAR productions, the Toy Story series and A Bug's Life, but even funnier.  John Goodman perfectly voices gentle, affable Sulley, and Billy Crystal creates Mike, a frantic egotist who is also optimistic and loyal.  In other words, with more depth than half the human characters being written today.  The animation is stunning, and the story is lots of fun.  Nothing here to disturb little kids, and a lot to entertain them.  The only part I didn't like much was the opening credit sequence, which was reminiscent of 60s bedroom farces, but that's what the Select Scene feature is for.There are two discs here.  On Disc One you can view the film in fullscreen or widescreen format.  Audio commentary by the director and staff is available with the latter.  English captions, audio and video optimizers, and sneak peeks at PIXAR's upcoming \"Finding Nemo\" and Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\" are also here.  Disc Two contains almost three-and-a-half hours of amazing dvd extras. There's an interesting 20-minute tour of PIXAR; a very funny bloopers reel (that also plays during the credits of the fullscreen version); storyboards; deleted scenes; recording studio footage; character design; trailers and tv spots; footage of the Hollywood premiere; discussion of tie-in toys; a poster gallery; two Monsters Inc.-related segments from Ponkickies, a goofy Japanese animated show; Peek-a-Boo, a game; a history of Monster World; a Monsters Inc. employee handbook; and an introduction to Monsters Inc.'s version of baseball cards called Scarer Cards.  The 13-minute original treatment and several scenes from an alternative story are presented that are as funny as the one that made it to the screen.Our favorite extras were the outtakes; a new animated short, \"Mike's Car\"; the Oscar winning PIXAR short, \"For the Birds\"; fly-arounds of several movie locations; the guide to \"in\" jokes (eg, the appearance of Toy Story 2's Jessie when Boo is showing her favorite toys to Sulley); a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the technical wizardry required to produce complex backgrounds, Sulley's fur, Boo's shirt and the city of Monstropolis; being able to watch a scene as it was done in storyboard, layout, animation or finished presentation; and a fun 4-minute clip with a few seconds of dialogue in each of the 30+ languages into which the film was translated.  There's even a brief appearance by PIXAR CEO Steve Jobs.Packaging and foldout are nice, and include a contest entry form (to win Disney dvds), a free tie-in storybook offer, and a coupon book (for popcorn; Monsters Inc. tie-ins; Disney storybooks, videos and dvds; and Disney on Ice).  With one exception we ran everything on our dvd player without a glitch, and could not be more pleased with this very funny family film and the many many extra features.Highest recommendation.", "qas": [{"question": "How about animation?", "id": "8594469dac5049ce8ce392abd9c8f471", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "When you watch this movie, you'll laugh...and be drawn in by the wonderful animation.

Tarantino presents his bloodletting with a verve and wit that at least maintains the aesthetic integrity of his films.  In Gangs of New York, Scorsese has no such excuse.  This is literal and graphic butchery, designed to disturb and nauseate.  His film set of nineteenth-century New York is avowedly theatrical rather than realistic and becomes a latter-day Coliseum in which are enacted scenes of gladiatorial slaughter.  The violence itself is realistic yet inauthentic, by which I mean it is heavily stylized and ritualized.  It portrays the imaginative cruelty typical of religious and political persecution rather than the workmanlike, crude brutality more characteristic of gang killings.  Situations are set up in artificial and implausible ways in order to provide opportunities for bloodier and nastier acts.The plot is cobbled together from incidents and characters culled from Herbert Asbury's \"The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld\", a 1927 concoction of lurid journalism and dubious anecdote.The irony is that the few concessions to historical truth that the movie makes are what has denied it wide acceptance by American audiences.  It shows the brutal hostility with which Irish immigrants were received in the New World and the terrible suffering they encountered there.  To a people comfortable with the well-established myth of poor Irish families escaping British tyranny to find freedom and prosperity in America, these truths are unacceptable.  The riots that form the climax of the movie are actual but little-known events, and the manner in which the rioters targeted blacks is not the least uncomfortable fact.  It is this indigestible history that curbed the movie's success, not the extreme violence, which it struggled despite, rather than because of.America today is a land where a little nudity, even when tastefully or humorously presented, on the large or small screen, provokes outrage, censorship and penalty, but the most pornographically explicit violence passes relatively unremarked.

Freedom always has a price tag. The people who've said that they don't like this movie are too ignorant and short-sighted to see why this film was made. Scorsese set out to reveal a part of our history that many Americans do not know about. It shows how immigrants had to fight to earn their place in America. Men like Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting(to say that Daniel Day-Lewis gave an excellent performance would be a gross understatement) despised all immigrants, especially Irish, and wanted to see them suffer, or leave on the boat they came in on. The immigrants had nowhere else to go, so they had no choice but to fight the 'natives' to earn their freedom in the land of the free. It's a stuggle we still face today. Racial and ethnic tensions are still prominent in 21st century America. This movie is important, because it shows how America became the melting pot of cultures it is today. The movie isn't violent for the sake of being violent. It shows how freedom's price tag is measured in how much blood is spilled. I am a descendant of Irish and Albanian immigrants, so this movie is really special to me. This movie is based on actual history, so for those who don't know much about 19th century America, I recommend digging into the supplements on the DVD. It'll help you understand the history depicted in the film, and it'll help you enjoy it even more. Scorsese's previous films, such as Goodfellas and Raging Bull, are excellent films, but Gangs of New York may be his best film to date. Scorsese was robbed of another Oscar, as was Day-Lewis. DiCaprio and Diaz were great, but Day-Lewis steals the picture. There are a lot of elements in the film, such as the corruption of Tammany Hall and 'Boss' Tweed, the Civil War draft riots, the deplorable conditions of the Five Points, as well as the struggle between the immigrants and the natives, but it's not that difficult to digest all of that information within 3 hours(the film doesn't feel too long, since there's not a single piece of film that lags).

For those who have read the book, they may find it slightly disappointed at the choices Peter Jackson (director) made in the story. Now I have read the book I was slightly disappointed by some of the things Jackson did in the movie. (Did Gandalf forgot that he was a wizard?) All the stirring parts of the book was totally ignored but he did make other parts quite exciting and entertaining so I guess it even out. I can lived happily with Jackson's version outside of one part. I thought his treatment of Frodo and Sam was pretty shameful in the end. Here was two hobbits who basically saved Middle Earth from ultimate evil and there was little or almost no real acknowledgement from the Aragon or people of Gondor. Yes, they did all bend their knees to them in one scene but they also honor Pippin and Merry as well, equalizing Pippin and Merry with Frodo and Sam must be considered as an ultimate insult to the latter two hobbits. Jackson should had Frodo carrying the crown of Gondor to Aragon instead of Gimili and  he and Sam should had the higher honor then any other, since their was the most important of all the quests. Aragorn became King only due to Gandalf and Frodo/Sam's effort, they should be honored above all else. Only other major weakness as a film goes, it had to do with the end.

It's more important to know that Resident Evil is as much an homage to George Romero films as it is to its video game origins, although I am sure many tried and true Romero fans won't like Resident Evil for its somewhat poor and certainly imitative borrowing of Romero's zombie ideas. Resident Evil doesn't stop there, as it borrows from other sci-fi and horror films; the method the Red Queen uses to kill several characters trapped in a corridor is lifted right out of the low-budget, cult favorite (and successfully eerie) film Cube. Paul Anderson is a talented filmmaker, to be sure, and Resident Evil is a slick looking film with sparkling clear photography. Anderson's screenplay isn't as simplistic as one might expect from this type of movie and it proceeds through a series of flashbacks to tell part of it story. Milla Jovovich, whose energy, presence, and looks always out-pace her acting, is just the type of actress to play Alice.

He is a man of few words, and Hanks gives real depth to what could otherwise have been a flat personality.  Indeed, I have one small complaint that perhaps Hanks gave the man too much depth...  except for his love for his family he isn't a great guy, and I didn't feel that he ever really made a moral connection between his chosen life and its consequences.  He loves his family and saves his son, and via this we see the man has a real soul despite being a killer.  At a few occasions Hanks just seemed too nice for the part!Newman is quite effective as the mob boss, and his dialog has the real moral lesson of the film.  In some ways, despite never reforming Newman is more aware of the consequences and costs of the mob life than Hank's character ever seems to be, and he gives his character real depth.  Jude Law is great as an exceptionally creepy supporting character!As for the dvd, video quality was quite good.  The film is dark at times but colors and contrast never really suffer.

His choices throughout the film are brilliant, whether in unexpected closeups or thoughtful and unusual camera placement and angles.

An aging mob boss (Paul Newman) must make the terrible choice between a baseless son and his adopted son whom he truly loves..  Their world is turned upside down and a quest for survival becomes a quest for redemption as well.As I said at the outset the cast is superb: Tom Hanks is completely believable in a different, darker role than we have seen him play before.

Cradling the box was like holding the holy grail of television in my own hands. No more watching \"Mary Tyler Moore\" on fuzzy reruns on obscure UHF stations or watching edited versions on Nick-At-Nite. It's all mine - the whole first season.When you watch the episodes, you'll find it hard to believe that in 1970 most television sets were still black and white, and stereo television was unheard of. Although the sound is mono, it comes across sharp and clear. The theme song never sounded better. The most striking aspect is the visual appearance of the show - bright and rich colors in the wardrobes and the sets. And best of all, no abrupt cuts or edits - these are the full-length episodes as originally aired!In one swoop, this DVD box set outdoes anything that was ever attempted for the VHS format. Many of you might recall the frustration of knowing that only two episodes per season were available on the MTM VHS box set. This DVD collection alone is twice as large - and there are six more sets to come! (By the way, for those of you who haven't yet bought the collection, an insert in the box says that the second season is coming out in March.)Now for a few minor criticisms.  Mind you, these criticisms are only the result of the high standards which this box set has in the first place.  First, only three of the twenty-four episodes have commentary. Commentators like Allan Burns, Jim Brooks, David Davis, Jay Sandrich, and Ed Asner (\"Mr. Asner\", as he is repeatedly called) bring out new and fascinating details and background tidbits, such as how the MTM cat was filmed, or how much they respected the acting talents of Nancy Walker and Cloris Leachman. Yet the commentary on these three episodes makes watching the other twenty-one more difficult, because you find yourself wondering what they would have said about the uproarious performance of Shelley Berman in \"Divorce Isn't Everything\", along with many other excellent scripts and guest stars over the course of the season.Second, although the \"making of\" documentary is well-done and fascinating, it left out some key material. Much was said about the infamous original scene filmed between Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner that flopped, but only stills were shown from the scene. I would have rather seen that scene in full as a bonus than some of the six nearly identical CBS promos (entertaining though they were).Overall, this is a five-star product for a five-star show.

Didn't like the way that sentence made you think? Then don't watch this movie. This is one of the craziest, most atypically typical movies to come out of recent years. And what should we expect from a guy (Spike Jonze) who brought us a movie about a porthole to John Malkovich's brain? 'Adaptation' stars Nicolas Cage, Chris Cooper, Meryl Streep, and... well, Nicolas Cage. It will go without saying 15 minutes into the film that it is not your average piece of work. Even if at the end it appears its as average as anything you've ever seen. I was a bit worried about all the praise set over the head of this film, but was more than impressed with almost all of its aspects. Alas, there were a few climactic points I found to be a bit disappointing. But then again, that's life.In this motion picture, Cage stars as Charlie Kaufman, who is presently struggling over a script for \"The Orchid Thief\" (a book about flowers) he's to adapt into a movie. The reason Kaufman struggles is not because he's unintelligent or a bad writer, but because he wants [his] film to be real. \"Real\" in the sense that it's only about flowers. Nothing more, nothing less. Genuinely precise; as he might envision. Saying that Charlie experiences an exceptional case of writer's block would be understating the situation rather nonchalantly. Along with his endless writing problems, he has a twin brother, Donald (Cage again), also a writer, who is frequently at his heels begging for helpful tips on his own screenplay; which is a thriller/horror film about split personalities and cops, entitled 'The 3' (go figure). What makes Don so amiable is that he does everything by the book. Or at least derived from whatever writing guru McKee (played brilliantly by Brian Cox) tells him. Fittingly enough, that's exactly how Charlie would never do it. Or so he thinks. There is great contrast betwixt Charlie and Don; allowing for some great comical passages. Those fruitful, but important scenes (along with the appearance by Ron Livingston), are the lone laughable ingredients in 'Adaptation'. And they're just enough. On top of it all, Charlie has troubles with his \"sex\" life. We won't even go there. When we are not seeing Charlie write and bicker with his identical twin, we see past assembly with John Laroche (Cooper) and Susan Orlean (Streep). Laroche is a scruffy but loveable orchid pilferer who becomes infamous when he's caught stealing a rare, endangered flower. He is then pursued by THE NEW YORKER journalist Susan Orlean, who consequently writes the book \"The Orchid Thief\" based on her experiences with Laroche and his flower-filled expeditions and stories. That somewhat brings you up to speed. The plot for 'Adaptation' is very long and (probably) too in-depth for me to review justly. And to be honest, if I kept going on and on it would spoil the film's originality and it's prominence as a \"great\" movie. Here, the hype is certainly not over-hyped.The few weak points I found within the movie are only weak points because I didn't like the way they flowed with the movie. The movie goes in a kind of slow, laid back manner that allows you to think while still being, to a large extent, entertained. During the climaxes--which are the only time you'll be expected to tolerate action sequences--the effects and affects were minimal compared to the dramatic and melodramatic parts. Some of them were very, very good (specifically the car crashes); but one in particular was upsetting. I won't spoil it for you. Still, as I said before, that's life. The acting by everyone is more than superb. It's obvious why they and the movie got so many Academy Award nominations (four, to be exact). Because this film is so incredibly different from 'Being John Malkovich', I can't say if you liked that one you'll like this one. I can, however, say that if you enjoy Nicolas Cage's work and/or an engaging thrill ride at the hands of flowers and wonderfully calculated drama- you will love 'Adaptation'. I highly recommend you watch this film before you go to bed.

It is one of those films that leaves no complaints while in the midst of enjoying it, but it isn't one that you're going to remember three days later.Make sense?The film tells the true story of con-man Frank Abagnale Jr., who by the time he was 21 had made a living at deceiving and `stealing' from the government.  He was a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while never being any of those things.  He was, simply put, a genius.  Carl Hanratty was the FBI agent who was on his tail for years, never quite getting close enough to catch him (well, eventually), always one step behind.One thing to describe this film is `jovial'.  It is a happy fun film.  Within the restraints of the genre it works nicely.  It does lack the `human' element that could have really set this film apart (and made it more memorable).  While the film remains exciting and entertaining it lacks that gut punch that could have made this movie `mean something', and in the end it would have completed it.  That said, happy is what happy does, and happy does a lot for this film.  Not only is the plot rather boisterous, but the performances are all just so delightful.  Leonardo DiCaprio captures the suave and childlike adorableness of Frank Jr. rather remarkably.  A lot of my cinephile friends consider this one of his best performances.  I kind of agree, since it really capitalizes on everything that makes him such an endearing actor.  This is a far better performance than his confused turn in `Gangs of New York', which was released the same year.  Tom Hanks is perfectly matched here, for he really understands how to play up the genre here.  As many know, I am not a gigantic fan of Mr. Hanks, so for me to praise a performance takes a lot from me.  But, as anyone who knows me knows, I consider his lighthearted `non-baity' work to be his best (see `Big' and `That Thing You Do' for examples).  Christopher Walken may not be the most jovial character in the bunch (and he does insert the films only `human' element) but he nails his character.Also, look for Amy Adams in a scene stealing supporting role!All in all, `Catch Me If You Can' delivers a very strong and very likable experience.

It is just a stupid story with unlikable characters.People say that the musical numbers in this movie were great.  I can't see how this is true.  These tunes are so unharmonic that its not even funny.  Mr. Cellophane?  He had it coming? What is this terrible cacophony?  In general, I'm not a hater of musicals, unlike some other reviewers.  I just hate this one.  If you want to see a good musical, see Paint Your Wagon.  That is at least amuzing and has likeable characters, including Clint Eastwood.Overall, I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is very very overrated and was a huge waste of money to produce.  I wish that I had the four dollars back that I paid to rent it.  I could have thrown that money down the sewage and gotten more satisfaction.

It was totally unexpected.The problem with prequels is that for the first part, we already know how they will end. With Star Wars III, we know exactly how it will end, before seeing a single frame - all Jedis but Vader, Obi Wan, and Yoda will die. Padme will die giving birth to Luke and Leah. Annakin will give himself over completely to evil, Senator/Chancellor Palatine will become the Emperor, and Vader and Obi Wan will have the final fight where Vader will be forever scarred and crippled, to live in his robotic suit. And, that's pretty much what happens. The movie settles all scores, and we can all say we've seen it.The bigger question to me is this, \"Do we really need to see it? Does that make it any better?\" I would say no - I had no need to see Annakin go in to the temple sanctuary to slaughter all the child Jedis. What exactly was the point? Nor did I need to see the killing of the Jedi heros. Why bother?If you are the type that wants to drive slow by an accident, then this is the 5 car crash, with bodies and gore by the bucket. In Lucas' attempt to seal our hatred for the Villains, he has made this film inappropriate for any child under 15, or maybe older. It is stuff like this that make our society more callous; for some reason I expected more from the man, who painted such a hopeful future in his child-friendly Star Wars: A New Hope.Personally, I am sorry, and a bit ashamed with myself. I used to know very well that some things are better in a story left to the imagination. But Lucas has appealed to the voyeur in us all, and we are drawn to see this happen, even though we know the story, and know it can only end one way.So, how well was it executed? Haydn's acting was much better, to which I was great relieved. Ewan's acting was excellent, and Padme hardly got a line (though she delivers the best line in the movie, \"So is this how liberty dies? With thunderous applause?\"). But the story seemed constricted, and every scene that was not a fight, a chase, or CGI, seemed affected by the outcome. It was like going through the inescapable motions of doom, with the characters barely able to scrape up real emotion or belief in the lines they deliver quite tersely, as they trudge along to their bleak destinies.But, as I said, I wasn't terribly disappointed; this is what is to be expected.I loved the effects, I loved the fight scene, and for a short time I even loved Palatine, for exposing the frailty of Jedi belief, and having them reckon for their pompous self-righteous rhetoric; the type that leads to putting people like him in power to begin with. But Annakin killing the children made my heart a stone for both him and the Emperor, so Lucas won out in the end. There were my bad guys, the good guys were clearly still the good guys, and all that was left was to see the showdown fight, and Annakin putting on his black armor.If you're a big fan, and you feel compelled to know, and your imagination cannot serve up a bigger, better, and more hopeful version, then I suggest to go.There is one ray of light for me - now hopefully Lucas can turn all this technology and money to something new for a change.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the beating scene?", "id": "95a33a684c7f485a8bc8f1ccb99d5f6d", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "When looking through the abundance of mostly positive reviews for Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, it is impossible not to detect a common theme amongst the vast majority of film critics. The final film of the Star Wars series is widely praised for its special effects and action sequences, while the atrocious dialogue and story is regarded as inconsequential. After all, these critics ask, who goes to a Star Wars film for the dialogue or for the story?It is stunning how many of these genuine experts on film manage to completely miss the point. While easy to dismiss the original three films as flighty fantasy, they are so much more than that. They are riveting tales of heroism, villainy, imagination, adventure, and redemption. To dismiss the story of the original films as unimportant and weightless is utterly ridiculous, with an apparent willingness to ignore that the series would hardly be the most famous in the history of cinema if the story around it was garbage. The original films at their lowest were still fantastic.The lack of a great story and the disregard for good dialogue is why Revenge of the Sith, while easily the best of the prequel films and a solid film overall, fails to reach the level of fantasy nirvana the original films achieved. Granted, Revenge of the Sith has a few exciting and even touching moments. It also contains an impressive number of action sequences, as many as any other two of the Star Wars films combined. Even for a jaded cynic, it would be difficult not to be impressed by the four lightsaber wielding cyborg villain, or the delightfully creative way in which Yoda and the evil Emperor duel in the massive Senate chamber. The peak of the film is also the key moment of the prequels, when the now evil Anakin Skywalker battles Obi-Wan Kenobi on a terrifying volcanic planet going into meltdown.But a staggeringly bad feeling perpetuates even these high-points, when you realize you that you don't care about the characters because of the prequel films, but because of their roles in the classic trilogy. Really, what has the whiny and annoying Anakin Skywalker done in the most recent two films to earn any sympathy from us at all? Where was the offbeat charm that made the wise Jedi Master Yoda steal all of his scenes in The Empire Strikes Back? Without something to care about, all of the lightsaber battles creator George Lucas can throw at us only amount to colorful but pointless noise. The only performance that adds anything new to the original characters is Ian  McDiarmid's vile Emperor Palpatine,  who adds a fiendishly wicked undertone to all of his lines.As any actor other than McDiarmid speaks his lines, it is impossible not to shake your head in disgust at George Lucas' direction. Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christiansen, Samuel L. Jackson, and all the rest have proven themselves as competent and even skillful film actors in their numerous other works. However, whenever the actors speak, they sound as if Lucas told them to phonetically pronounce every word in the script, and to leave out any and all emphasis unless they are screaming the name of another character. The stilted dialogue does not do much for the computerized scenery, which varies wildly in quality. Scenes such as the opening space battle and the volcanic world look amazing, while settings such as the Emperor's office are drenched in CGI overkill. It's as if Lucas decided that since the audience knows the locations are fake, then they mise as well not even try to make many of the effects look real. When compared to the brilliant and weighty set design of the first three films, it is obvious that the decision to populate nearly every frame with CGI is a huge mistake.Leaving the theater is a sad experience. Despite all of its flaws, Revenge of the Sith is still a Star Wars movie, and the better moments of the film beg you to love it. The heart may want what it wants, but the head is still there.

(puns intended) It seems they can do no wrong as each film outing seems to be hailed by critics, audiences, and pretty much everyone as cinematic gems. Their latest Finding Nemo is certainly no exception and can stand right alongside Toy Story, Monsters Inc and the rest as movie magic. When I watch these films I almost forget they're actually some pretty impressive computer work because they stories and characters are so appealing and well done. Pixar is the ultimate \"family film\" creators not because they create great films that kids can watch, but they makes films that everyone can not only watch, but enjoy things on their own level. In that way they're not only the new Disney, but the new Muppets as well.The visuals of Finding Nemo are that much more adventurous and successful than it's predecessors. The work that went into not only creating a assortment of under-sea creatures but their environments (and the actual water) is awe evoking. It's amazing how much hard work we instantly take for granted in these films because the visual work is so, well, perfect that we don't have thoughts to find any flaws in it (I'm pretty sure there aren't any anyways). The recreation of Sydney Harbor is pitch perfect and it's just a treat to sti back and take it all in.Our story revolves around a overprotective clownfish, Marlin (Albert Brooks), who lost his wife and all but one egg to a shark attack and all he is left with is Nemo (Alexander Gould), his young adventurous son. Nemo is his life and he won't chance losing him too so he goes overboard in sheltering him. You can see where the story is going with a son that wants to break free and a parent  who needs to learn to let go and two people that need to meet in the middle of it all. Nemo finally does break free and does so too boldly and becomes a capture of a Sydney, Australia dentist who makes Nemo a resident of his office fish tank. Marlin can't let his life slip away so easily and sets out to rescue his son any way he can.Marlin is joined by a  blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who becomes his son  away from Nemo in many ways, but only this time he allows his companion to have the freedom they deserve. DeGeneres is achingly funny as the memory challenged fish and Brooks is ideal to play a neurotic worrywart like Marlin. Along their trip they meet a group of fish-free sharks (\"fish are friends, not food\" is their mantra), navigate a visually breathtaking jelly-fish field, and catch some waves with some surfer dude style turtles. Nemo's tale involves his initiation into the fish tank crew and their plans to help him get back to the ocean, which is plotted out by a fellow ocean native Gill (Willem Dafoe), an Idol fish. The tank crew provided many of my favorite parts of the film, especially their knowledge of dentistry they've picked up in their extended stay in the tank. They've also got a contact on the outside, a pelican (Geoffrey Rush) called Nigel, who ends up playing the middle man and ends up helping the two groups find each other.I think as of right now Finding Nemo is the funniest in the Pixar cannon and I consistently found myself laughing. The casting is perfection, as is the norm for these films, and I can't express enough times how great the likes of DeGeneres, Dafoe, and Rush were in this film. I've almost forgotten to mention the fantastic sound design that helps complete the experience, as well as the nifty score by Thomas Newman, who gives Pixar a change from the usual Randy Newman score. The film has morals throughout, but the best part of them is that they're given time to work themselves out in a natural way and are rarely forced out.

It would have been nice Linda Hamilton and Ed Furlong (the kid who played John Conner in T2)to return but not everything is perfect in life.  This easily one of Arnold's best movies he has made in years.  But compared to the first two, this is the worst Terminator movie yet, but it is still a mind blowing action-packed thrill ride.  Atnold's back and better then ever and has his mind set on a new intense adventure as a machine.  Anyway, here is the plot..It has now been ten yrs since skynet was blown away.  Sarah Conner is now deceased and John Conner is now basically doing whatever he can to avoid the life he was destined for.  He basically does what he can to stay alive and keeps traveling hundreds of miles but really has no idea where he is going.  Nut it turns out that blowing up Skynet doesn't prevent Judgement Day; it only postponed it.  That means that the Terminators will still exist, and now there is one a new and very advanced one.  It is called the T-X (Terminatrix), played by Kristanna Loken who is wicked hot!  She is Faster, stronger,and can control and heavy machinery with her mind .  As in she can drive a car, but she won't be in the car, she will be somewhere else while her mind will be controlloing the car.  This Terminator is sent to do the obvious-Kill John Conner.  But that is not all.  Conner isn't going to be the only general in the war against the machines in the future.  There will be other generals in the war and the T-X must kill everynody who will become a general in the future right now so they won't be able to fight in the war.  Also a T-850 (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  It is slighlty more advanced then the T-800's that were sent back in the first 2 films.  His mission is of course protect Conner and his fri9end Kate Brewster (Clare Danes).  It seems that Brewster's father is the man who will create Skynet and is almost finished with the project.  Now it is up to them to stop that from happening and before the T-X can get to them and terminate them.  One other thing, Earl Boen makes a small reappearence as Dr. Silberman (the guy who treated Sarah Conner in the first 2 films)Anyway, T3 is loaded with instense action and lots of destruction.  This film had the most destruction out of the 3.  The only thing that keeps that this film from getting a perfect 5/5 is that part is confusing and there are some things in this movie that seem ridiculous.  Things such as the T-850 kicking an ambnulance and cousing it to tip over.  This film however doesn't come close to as good as the second was.  T2 was way better, even the original Terminator (1984) was better.  But this is still good and should be ssen while it is still in theaters.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the scene?", "id": "8e6be7a66c3f037370644007b9695cfd", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JM5E", "paragraphs": [{"context": "There have been a lot of half-crazed movie characters in film history, you know the one; the kind of vaguely insane person that the movie truly revolves around, with the other characters only there to provide stark contrast with their recognizably sane posture.  They're also there to wonder aloud to themselves and each other, &quot;What's the matter with him?&quot;  To which someone usually responds, &quot;I don't know, but there's something about him that I like.&quot;  The thing about those movies (a lot of them came out of the 80's and early 90's, I know because in school we all imitated them), was the the core of those movies was the zany character exploration, and that was just about it.  See what kind of situations we can cook up and then throw this crazed, witty personae in there and see what happens.What's different about Pirates of the Caribbean, and Jack Sparrow in particular, is that the world he inhabits gave birth to him.  In the crazed personae movie--the nut-job seems to come out of nowhere, completely unexpected, which is half the fun but also half the shortcoming.  In Pirates of the Carribean, we expect Jack Sparrow to come sailing out of the horizon and to suddenly arrive in that world, and what a world!I think what lends Sparrow such credibility is his mixture of characterization.  Yes, he's wild and I suppose &quot;free,&quot; but there are moments where he gets serious (saluting the dead pirates), moments when he has to act and can pull through (like jumping in to save Elizabeth), moments where he has to educate (telling Will Turner the truth about his father).  When this happens, we give the character Sparrow something we don't give the hollow, crazed personae; respect.  Give Johnny Depp all the credit for being able to switch between these modes as well; being serious and respectable while maintaining the aura of Jack Sparrow; that he'll stick his tongue out at us and run off with the gold at any moment, but not without his effects.The world of &quot;Black Pearl&quot; is lush and surprising.  I didn't expect to believe the world of pirates, where all the exsists is ocean and the few ports that you can sail to.  Come to think of it, we only really see three locales during the whole movie, and the rest of it is on water.  How'd they pull that off?  My favorite scene is in the pirate pub where the bar-fight is perpetual; Jack Sparrow and his cohort (can't remember his name) sit and talk about ports, treasures, old pirates, schemes, boats, etc. all in the warm glow of candles and wood as they chug ale.  A pirate's life for me!Geoffery Rush, brilliant as ever.  When he says, &quot;Too long have I been without the taste of food or the comfort of a woman&quot; I believe him.  The man is a pirate outright, but in his eyes you can see the years of torment on a man from the curse piling up on him slowly.  Notice too how he rolls his eyes perfectly when he's at the moment of breaking the curse, and somehow Jack Sparrow convinces him not to.  How?  Maybe &quot;Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is really how Jack Sparrow has dogged Barbossa his whole career.The supporting cast is good, even Orlando Bloom who is still in Legolas mode.  Even though he played up Will Turner nicely as a bright-eyed, talented, somewhat intense young man (who has serious anxieties about his lineage, but why not?  It would bar him from his chances of Elizabeth), I did keep expecting him to jump up and go, &quot;He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn!&quot;  He does have a great moment where he jumps onto a ship with Sparrow and goes, &quot;Aye, avast!&quot; to which he's promptly laughed at.", "qas": [{"question": "How fun  is the story?", "id": "2da058232da4aa3c4c84e821d3c90796", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Firstly, lets bare in mind that there hasn't been a good pirate movie in a while.

A lost boy on a wrecked ship holds the gold around his neck. A young girl retrieves it and holds on to it while they both grow up.

But, like all pirates, he's always looking for a way out, a way in, or just a way to a good angle.Throughout the adventures of Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Jack, we are steady as she goes and just begging for more and more and get delivered more and more excitement followed by endless laughs.The jokes are well-executed, the special effects are good and not overally done, the plot is solid, the amount of settings is vast and beautiful, and the choreography of the sword fights is amazing.All the way you'll be rooting for Captain Jack Sparrow and glued to your seat with rambunctious delight.You'll love it.

Nontheless Pirates of the Caribbean made a good return of the genre to the audience.Frankly, judging from the dodgy and lengthy title, there was not much hope about it being either entertaining or creative. However, with Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom as the leading cast, the attraction of the movie rocketed immediately. Johnny Depp, playing the weird ex-pirate head who got dumped on an isolated island in the middle of nowhere provided a lot of essential credits to the movie. His performance is stunning and spectacular and managed to turn this old jerk into a half-weighted hero. His gestures and all the small movements he created for the character did add a lot of spice to make the character jump out of the script. Johnny Depp once again proved that he could transform any roles into a real character that could last in people's mind.Geoffrey Rush as the cursed power and wealth hungry pirate provided a lot of dynamics to the movie, especially when he was working with Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. The whole movement of the story just came in and pushed the plot forward. Although working will strong actors like Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, the two young cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were not worse off in performance. They showed great integrity in their characters and were able to match with their strong counterparts perfectly. Orlando Bloom still needs time to shake his Legolas image off, but everything needs to have a start and it seems that this is a good start for him. Keira Knightley showed huge difference when compared to her role in Bend it Like Beckam. Both of them should have good chance in the acting career should they be able to choose their roles carefully in the future.The special effects of the movie concentrated on the transformation of the cursed sailor crew at different occasions and they were well done.

In fact, the only reason I went to see it at all was because my sister wanted to see it, and it was her birthday. So, how could I not? Well, am I ever glad I did! It was a most enjoyable experience. While the film is long, running nearly two and a half hours, it did not seem so, as it is a fun filled, action packed delight that is sure to entertain people of all ages.The story revolves around pirates with Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. He is a pirate who has lost his ship, The Black Pearl, to his arch enemy, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who led a mutiny against Sparrow. Unfortunately for Captain Barbossa, he and the mutineering crew commandeered some valuable booty that carried with it a curse that turned the ship and all aboard into a ghost ship, damned for all eternity, unless the booty is returned in its entirety to its rightful place. Therein, lies the tale.Captain Sparrow, desperate to recover his ship, ends up on an island where his antics bring him in contact with the Governor's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and the local blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who is in love with the delectable Ms. Swan. Before you know it, they all end up together in a rollicking adventure on the high seas.Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley turn in smart, top of the line performances, as does Jonathan Pryce, as the island Governor. Orlando Bloom also gives an excellent performance, though I found him decidedly unattractive in this film, thin lipped and sallow. It is Johnny Depp, however, who steals the show, a drolly funny and totally delightful scamp. Notwithstanding the fact that he has the best lines, Depp infuses the film with an infectiousness that is hard to resist. He literally makes the film.The special effects are spectacular and the film provides fun for the whole family, though given the special effects, it is probably wise to leave those who are five and under at home.

It's about time Hollywood gave us something this complete.As Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp worked hard for that Oscar nod without every really working at all.  His performance I guaranty you was not one he was campaigning for an Oscar, it's far too natural for that, and that's why I feel so overjoyed about his nomination.  It's not a performance that the Academy all too often notices for it has nothing they look for yet it proved to be everything they needed to award.  Becoming completely absorbed in his character he's almost unrecognizable here, and that what sets Depp apart from most of the pack in the first place, dire dedication and devotion to a role.The plot here revolves around a group of undead pirates trying to break the curse that binds them in their `undead' state.  The leader of this group is Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who now commands The Black Pearl, a ship once belonging to Jack Sparrow.  In an attempt to reverse this curse they kidnap the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) and this leaves her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), up in arms.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the blacksmith who secretly pines for Elizabeth's attention, is determined to find her and so he enlists the help of Sparrow (who's determined solely to regain command of his ship) in order to track down the undead and rescue his love.As I said, this film has everything you could wish for in a motion picture.  It has the action and adventure, plenty of eye candy (I personally prefer the gorgeous Keira Knightly but my wife is a major fan of Depp here), one liners and general hilarious scenes and did I mention those brilliantly slick special effects.  All the performances are great, Depp the standout as well as Rush who is splendidly iconic, but it was probably the biggest booster for young talent Keira Knightly who I'm sure was instantly noticed, not just for her beauty but also her dynamic chemistry with the screen.

Credit Rush with a formidable challenge to Depp's idiosyncratic performance. Having already stolen Jack Sparrow's ship (what else? The Black Pearl), his Captain Barbossa almost steals center stage as well. Almost. Director Gore Verbinski generally keeps the plot moving along. The special effects are outstanding. All members of the cast seem to be in perfect alignment with the whimsical tone. Credit Jonathan Pryce (Governor Swann) with keeping a straight face throughout all the nonsense. As with the Monty Python and Naked Gun films, it is imperative for everyone involved to sustain, indeed nourish a sense of gravitas.

More things get blown and/or broken to bits in this film than in the last three I've seen combined. However, this isn't a bad thing, as the action makes for some of the most spectacular scenes in my recent memory.The film starts out promisingly, and sets itself up fairly quickly. Elizabeth Swann (played irritatingly feministic by Keira Knightley), on her way to the Caribbean with her father, the governor of one of the islands, saves the life of a young lad floating amidst the wreckage of a - what else? - pirate ship. He wears about his neck a gold coin, which curious Elizabeth can't help but filch. (She later explains that it was to save young Will Turner from being branded a pirate, but that failed to convince me that she wasn't just being sticky-fingered. She is a pirate wanna-be, after all.)Flash-forward eight years. (At least, that is how long the film says it is, although the two protagonists seem to have aged more than that.) Elizabeth is now a beautiful socialite (with an impassioned hatred of corsets) who spends her days warding off unwelcomed advances. Will is a less-than-brawny blacksmith (who is, I must add, very nicely toned, just not as bulky as I expected of a blacksmith) who never seems to get any credit for all his work and practises three hours a day with swords. (Jack Sparrow suggests this implies Will needs to get a girl.) Will does have one, though she's the classic maiden-adored-from-afar-off: he's been smitten with Elizabeth since he set eyes on her. She, it seems, harbours an affection for him that she will not quite admit to.Into this mix comes (or rather, floats) Jack Sparrow (sorry, that's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow), the \"best pirate I've ever seen.\" His entrance into the film is absolutely brilliant comedy, so I won't spoil it for the dozen or so people who haven't seen the film yet. Johnny Depp handles this role so well, makes Jack Sparrow so hysterically outlandish, that he makes you completely forget that pirates are indeed very nasty things instead of incredible comics with freaky eye-makeup and braided beards. (This is more than made up for by Geoffrey Rush, who as Captain Barbossa convinced me that he was indeed a very, very nasty thing.)Capt. Jack manages to get captured - and escape - several times before the \"real\" action begins. These scenes are hilarious; I laughed aloud so often it was good I had the theatre to myself. He runs into Will Turner, who defends Elizabeth from a perceived offence in a swordmatch that is absolutely breathtaking. I have never, ever seen swordplay so fast, so clever, and so funny all at once. Some have called Orlando Bloom the next Errol Flynn, and I heartily agree: he handles himself well in his roles, and his polished good looks and lightning-fast moves look splendid onscreen. He's got just enough \"darkness\" to him - those smoldering brown eyes, that dark, slightly uncontrollable hair - to make him believable. (And this comes from a woman who doesn't even profess to be a Screaming Fan-Girl.)As with most action flicks, the plot is disposable, but not too stupid; if you are going to see a Pirate Film, you're likely not expecting a deeply insightful social commentary anyway. As it's not at all necessary to the enjoyment of seeing the film, I shan't bother summarising it at all.The screenplay itself sizzles with wit, especially from Jack (who has all the best lines in the film), and the stunts and lavish costumes are enough to keep one thorougly enjoying oneself. (Who can object to slightly tight silk trousers and flowy shirts open to the waist, exposing tanned, toned bodies? Not me!) The locations are absolutely gorgeous - I wouldn't be surprised if the Caribbean cruise lines are booked solid after people see some of the places in this film!There's not much in the movie to warrant a PG-13 rating - some doe-eyed looks, hand-holding, and one kiss at the very end are the limit of the onscreen romance - but I think this was more for caution than content. Some children might find the undead crew turning to skeletons in the light of the moon rather frightening (my mother did, but she has never been one for zombies). This is really handled fairly well, though, as the macabre effect is lightened by a quirky sense of humour. (The idea of a disembodied arm having a fight with a person is hilarious to me.)There really is only one minor quibble I have with this film: I could have done without Elizabeth. (I don't know that Will Turner would have appreciated this much, but he could always have had me instead...) In her day she'd have been locked up in a convent for her conduct; it simply wasn't acceptable. Strong-willed, smart-aleck heroines may work in modern-day films, but I found her distractingly anachronistic in a \"period\" piece. (For instance, trouser-wearing is completely out of the question.) Playing her slightly more demurely girl-like would have suited me much better.All in all, it's no stirring insightful piece, but that's not what we go to the movies for. It is, however, a rollicking good time, one of the best experiences I've had in the theatre for years.

Harry Potter fans should not be worried though, as some of the missing material will find its way into later movies.  The three primary child actors seem more comfortable than ever in their roles, and have grown up a bit since HP2.  Whether or not they will ride it out until the end of the series remains to be seen, but I think it would be difficult to see anyone else in their roles.HP3 is also the first, and probably only movie to not have You Know Who in it, and that gives a nice breather before things to come.  HP3 is an excellent movie that will not disappoint fans of the series.

The challenge of translating the beloved books to screen has indeed taken some time to perfect.  The first two films were good, but not great.  This one is great.  Everything comes together; the acting, the story, the flow, and the magic.  If anything, I felt that the first two films really lacked that magical, wondrous feeling of the books.  Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n captures this and then some!  I was truly enchanted by this film and I think that Cuar&oacute;n should be given the credit.  He really pulled together a film franchise that was most definitely taking a nosedive.  People were becoming disinterested with the films and all that Potter had to offer.  It was all becoming the same and fairly repetitive.With the books, \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" was where J.K. Rowling's writing style and the storyline began to change and get much darker and involving.  This was the perfect opportunity for producers to turn things around and they did beautifully.  The magic is back!As the franchise matures, so do the youthful actors.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all matured tremendously and really become their characters this time around.  Before it was \"Look, there's Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter!\"  Now, Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter.  In addition to satisfying performances by Potter newbies Gary Oldman and David Thewlis, audiences get to enjoy the always-wonderful Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, etc. And while it's sad to see the deceased Richard Harris gone from his role as the lovable Dumbledore, we couldn't have asked for a better successor than Michael Gambon.The story is extra-dark this time, as Harry returns to school for a third year with the knowledge that the murderous Sirius Black has escaped from prison and is likely to be looking to add Harry to his roster of victims. It's not particularly reassuring that Hogwarts is being guarded by a spooky group of Nazgul-reminiscent (\"Lord of the Rings\") Dementors, as they're just about as dangerous as the man they are trying to capture and certainly more scary!  Harry, Hermione and Ron get themselves into loads of trouble this time around, as they try to sort out who's really dangerous and who is on their side.", "qas": [{"question": "What do you think about actor is better?", "id": "74b98db7984ceb194c8730467dedf282", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I wasn't at all a fan of the HARRY POTTER franchise because I was lead to believe that these stories were strictly for children.

But what made it more appealing was that there was more depth in the characters, it seemed to me that more was at stake, emotionally.  The dementors in particular were frightening.  I still can't believe I was under the impression that these books are for children.  I think they are more about children rather than for children. I have since read the third book and still say the director and the screenwriter (the same for the past two movies) were spot on with their adaptation.  What really impressed me were the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, very much improved since the last two films and I hope they are around for the conclusion of the series of films.  I hope that these two actors continue with their careers after this franchise is over.  I have read books four and five and am chomping at the bit for book six to come out.

The pacing was faster, the stakes were higher for the characters, and the adventure more sweeping.  I have read the third book and the main two things that are missing are the references to the Marauder's, which I've heard would be covered in a different film, the extended arguments between Ron and Hermione, and the significance of Crookshanks (which I feel works in the book better, if presented in a movie, it would have seemed too contrived).I hope that this film in the series gets some recognition *hem hem* Best Adapted Screenplay *hem hem*.

Revenge is the film's theme taken to extremes and Uma Thurman does a fine job seeming to capture exactly what Tarantino had in mind.There were moments in watching the film that I wanted to take it seriously, but as the blood gushed forth endlessly, this was difficult to do. Tarantino appears to have a compulsion about seventies kitsch; somehow intending to make the tasteless and outlandish move beyond hip. The movie is tasteless, ultra-violent, but violent in a comic book context. I suppose this is why the violence lost its impact, because it's meant to be fantasy, dreams of a pubescent boy.There is no depth to this film in terms of narrative because it is really all about imitation and form. This film is not about the story, but a rendering of style, delivery and surfaces that sparkle. It is advertising copy stretched into a feature film. And as all good advertising does, it will grab our attention, dazzle our base emotions, manipulating our sensibilities, turning us into impulsive shoppers.This film is very clever, but that's exactly the point. This is about the wonder boy, Tarantino, reinforcing his image as wonder boy filmmaker, proving again how clever he really is. It is cleverness for its own sake.

There is never a dull moment and the viewer cheers for the Bride, despite the fact she's also an assassin who's out to kill people. Part of that is due to her reason for revenge, and part is due to Tarantino's style which actually makes the movie \"fun\" in a way.By now I think most people are prepared for the amount of violence in Tarantino's films. In this movie he takes advantage of the freedom in an anime-type sequence to have even more blood. The violence in \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" is over-the-top to the point where it's humorous at times.The performances by all the actors are very good, especially Thurman. While there is plenty of action, there are also a good number of dramatic scenes and it does include some humor.

Obviously, Kill Bill carries lots of elements from those voilence movies & animations. Chopping humen heads, arms, legs off, bleeding like a jet stream. Going for extreme bloody but in contrast, not gross at all. There're lots of fighting scenes one by one without giving you any spare time for restroom. Tarantino carefully plans to show audiences extreme violence via animation way ahead of the real people getting heads chopped off. Making sure we're all well psycholoically prepared before watching the real people heads off, arms off, and legs off when the bride swinging her samurai sword.

In fact, I think if the two volumes had cross-pollinated a little more, you wouldn't have had just a good movie and a half, but two great films.But for now, Kill Bill Vol. 1.  It's the &quot;action&quot; half of the twins, and it dazzles right from the start with an audacious, extended extreme close-up on Uma Thurman's face.  The scene after, the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green, is classic Quentin Tarantino, heralding a return to his outrageous, dramatically intense roots.  Probably the strongest scene he's directed since the Mr. Pink-Mr. White altercation in Reservoir Dogs.  Unfortunately, after The Bride wakes up from her coma, the dramatic content flies down the meter, with a lot of posing and one-liners but very little in terms of character or emotional satisfaction.  Which means it's up to the endless action set pieces to grab our attention.  And they do.  However, I find them a little too bloody, even though I've spent the last 16 months digging through Shaw Brothers films (through the excellent Celestial Pictures VCD and DVD releases).  The endless bloodletting in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is shocking in the beginning, but after about five minutes in the extended climactic massacre, it's numbing.And for the record, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not a Shaw Brothers kind of film, despite the Shaw logo which opens the film.  You would have to wait until the &quot;training&quot; sequences in Vol. 2 to get Shaw Brothers-style cinema (which Tarantino appropriates very well there).  Vol. 1 is much more a paean to the Japanese style of filmmaking:  Extremely saturated colours courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson (even Shaw films didn't go this far in terms of garish colours -- we're in '80s Kurosawa territory here), emphasis on extreme wide shots, the very long builds, the brilliant music by The RZA.  And the martial-arts sequences are modern in their multi-angularity and speed cuts; Shaw Brothers action as epitomized by Chang Cheh's style focuses much more on choreography and mise en scene than multi-angularity, letting long medium shots capture the movement of the actors and fighters, relying very little on cuts.All in all, the most lacking element in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is still story and character.  Uma Thurman has some great moments (such as when The Bride first wakes up in the hospital), but after those blazing first 30 minutes, she will mostly become a statuesque hellfire angel who doesn't have a great deal of emotional advancement.  You will get that in spades in Vol. 2, which is hands down a superior story and film -- without the visual eye candy and endless action of Vol. 1, but with such powerful dramatic moments that it barely matters.  Again, I think if Tarantino had been able to meld the action and the drama a little more, rather than separate them into two movies that contain most of one and almost none of the other, he would have made both films greater than what they are.  As it stands, Vol. 2 will be what truly burns these characters and Tarantino's vision into your mind, while Vol. 1 is the adrenalized thrill ride with energy to spare, but without much in terms of thematic depth.", "qas": [{"question": "Does the soundtrack perfect?", "id": "5b795b4f206dcf10fba745b7191da118", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Kill BillQuentin Tarantino has a unique ability to create violent films that combine almost Haiku like moments of extreme mayhem with cutting humor and drama.  The inevitable result is a viewer who sits magnetized for the duration and then must puzzle through a variety of simultaneous reactions to the film.  In 'Kill Bill,' starring Uma Thurman as an assassin dead set on revenge when her wedding is turned into a bloodbath, Tarantino not only lives up to all expectations but develops a whole new grammar in the process.Both killers and 'The Bride' were once a deadly team (the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) but broken apart by Thurman's desire to retire to a more normal life.  This is the first film in a series that will follow 'The Bride' as she takes on each of her tormentors, culminating in a final confrontation with Bill, their leader.  For this stanza her targets are Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu.What sets the film apart is that it is conscious of its art.  While very much a lampoon of several genres (samurai, lady assassin, Yakuza, spaghetti western, etc.), Tarantino uses black and white as well as animation to set aspects of the story apart.  Experiment shot angles and sudden changes of scene also build the nervous energy that marks the entire film.  We shift from church to hospital to kitchen and back again like jumping jacks.  One moment we are in a nightclub full of whirling killers, and the next we are in a Zen garden in mid-winter.The result is a visual extravaganza - sudden perfectly choreographed moments that whirl by almost to quickly to absorb.  The script is as terse as the visuals are complex.  This is physical acting, not narrative development.  Tarantino pays surprising attention to the musical work, both the scoring (flamenco samurai?) and the madcap gyrations of the 5, 6, 7, 8's who turn surfer music into a post-modern experience.The violence, of course, is way over the top, even for Tarantino.  Revenge pushes all other considerations out of the way, and I can't think of any scene that someone won't find offensive.  In a sense, this is a harrowing look at aspects of our psyches that contradict our preferred view of ourselves.  Tarantino allows no space to be sacred or safe.

In the wake of the Matrix films and Lord of the Rings, he could cut his four-hour flick in half and release it 6 months apart. Ten years ago, he might not have been able to. By cutting it in half, he took a long, rambling movie and turned it into two tight movies. This DVD, the first part, moves fast. It's funny, violent, and full of memorable scenes and images.Another reason it's such a smart move: Tarantino is a movie geek, so he can throw in dozens of \"homages\" to his favorite kung fu movies in this movie. If you get the references (like Uma wearing Bruce Lee's yellow motorcycle outfit) that's great. If not, you don't miss out on anything essential.Tarantino is still mixing up the sequence of events, telling the story out of order, and it still works. The audience can follow along the first time, but the movie is better the second or third time, when you have a better idea of who's who and what's going on. In Pulp Fiction, the out-of-order sequence puts you off-balance. This time, he's so good at it, you can't imagine telling the story any other way.Tarantino challenged himself in Kill Bill to shoot great action sequences, and he succeeded. The fights are the high points. They are suspenseful, intercut with humor and dialogue, and too stylized to be taken seriously. The swordfight at the end is fantastic, even if you only pay attention to the lighting. (Which brings me to Robert Richardson, the cinematographer for Kill Bill. Best known for his work on Natural Born Killers and other Oliver Stone movies, he's the guy who puts the glowing light behind everyone. Overhead lights shimmer in the hair of actors, and windows bleed light around the edges. It's a nice effect.)You can't go wrong with this film. Although the DVD doesn't have a lot of extras, the movie itself is worth it. Tarantino has developed his directing and writing style, making it simpler without losing any of his trademarks: the Seinfeld-like conversations, the long takes, the camera-in-the-trunk point of view, sudden bursts of violence, and fake product placement.

Being there twice, I can relate to the sounds, the people, the design, and anything in this great visual ode to one of the most amazing cities in the world.  Having studied Japanese for the last 18 months, I can understand some of the dialogues and understand why the east and west has such a gap that could create this relationship/story.  Most amazing is the small detail of the 'Dr. Who Sci Fi' hum of machinery within cooridors and buildings that masks a constant noise of choatic human activity just beyond the walls of any room.  And more evidently, the story of miscommunication and alienation within a world in your face, yet emotionally beyond your reach is relayed brilliantly.This film will grow with the Japophile, and be a sweet romance to anyone unfamiliar with the idea of being segregated within a society they can't relate to.

In general, the acting was excellent, the photography was good, and the script was mediocre.This is a story about two dissatisfied people who meet and can relate to one another.  It's a story that's been told a million times before, most famously in its incarnation as the British classic &quot;A Brief Encounter&quot;.  &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; sports far better performances by its leads and will of course be more accessible to a contemporary audience, but suffers from a weaker script.Living in (and loving) Japan myself, I found many of the stereotypes to be untrue and, occassionally, objectionable.  However, &quot;Japan&quot; was not the theme of this movie.  The characters could have been anywhere, so long as it was someplace that made them feel like &quot;outsiders&quot;, and Tokyo, as it is presented in the West, is a modern location which most Westerners think of as distant in every sense of the word.  Of course, the Tokyo presented in this film is the image we get in the States (via Hollywood, television, and any number of fringe news articles about social trends and electronic gadgets), as opposed to the real place.  As an example, for those of you who have been to New York City, compare the real thing with the city presented to you in the movie &quot;Seven&quot;, which plays to every stereotype purveyed by those who have never visited of crime, perversity and destitution.The slow speed of the film did not bother me in the least.  It's a film about the characters, not their environment, past, or future.  It's a study of loneliness and anger.  Charlotte, an otherwise educated woman, bad-mouths everything she sees or tries, from the lunch she eats with Bob (&quot;shabu-shabu&quot;, which is delicious, by the way), to the pronunciation of the locals' English.  This shouldn't be confused with an endorsement of those sentiments on the part of the director.  Rather, it is a window into the character's own youth (read: childishness) and inexperience, coupled with her deep unhappiness with her own life.I do not agree that most people who have visited a foreign environment should relate to this.  I fully endorse a number of other reviewers who have mentioned that a normal person would be interested in the adventure of Japan, of seeing new things, and of interacting with new people.  But Bob and Charlotte are not normal people.  If they were, there would be no movie.  What makes a movie worth watching (any movie) is that it is about something out of the ordinary, whether that something occurs outside of the characters or inside.That said, I often found Bob's jokes at the expense of the people around him to be in bad taste.  Almost every Japanese person he met in this movie was going out of their way to be kind and make him feel at home, but he often made fun of them.  This is the kind of behavior that is often considered &quot;cool&quot; in the West, but you won't find much of it in Japan, thank goodness.I've mentioned above, you don't need to agree with everything these characters do- they're not heroes- but his actions damaged my ability to sympathize with him.As for the dialogue itself, this is a film with less dialogue than average, so it was a pity to see so many throw-away lines.  I realize that most of the acting and character-development was silent, but that's no reason not to have quality dialogue also.  A small example of this is the scene in the strip-club.  Nothing here is said of any imporance.  In fact, the entire scene could have been lifted right out of the movie without effect.Finally, to review the DVD itself.  Please note that my rating of four stars is for the film, not the DVD, which would get two at best.  This is the one and only DVD I have ever owned or rented which actually requires you to watch all of the previews.  To me, this is unforgiveable, and it is enough to ensure that I will never purchase another title from Focus Features.  The only option you have is to fast-forward, old-fashioned VCR-style.  This is bad enough, but my own player has only 2x fast forwarding available, making the process annoying, to put it extremely mildly and expletive-free.In short, this film is worth watching at least once, but (DVD aside) I doubt it will stand up to repeat viewings for most people.", "qas": [{"question": "How is cinematography?", "id": "8a33de11a968d218b1fb010a7aa4cac2", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "First, let me say \"Bravo Sophia Coppola!\"  She did a wonderful job with both the script and directing.

Kate Winslet's hair color was used as a clever way to help keep track of where we were in time, but for me it wasn't enough.

The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.  That being said, I do feel I would be able to give it an unbiased review if I didn't like it, but thankfully, that was not the case.Spider-Man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.  I've never been in a theater where I've felt an audience have so much fun at a movie.  This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought the special effects looked a bit shoddy, but the final release was amazing.  Everything was seamless, and the attention to detail was very noticeable.  One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.  I didn't expect to laugh going into Spider-Man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.  The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.  It's great watching Parker trying to deliver pizzas in his costume to meet a deadline, or being forced to use an elevator and make small talk with the other occupant.  Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.Raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.  The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.  From having to live in a run down apartment, to never having any money.  Too many Super heroes come from wealthy backgrounds and have an unlimited supply of money, but Spider-Man is just a below-average teenager who's given an incredible ability. And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.  As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.  In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.  There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft-quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.It does have a few faults, albeit they're hard to notice.  I found that some of Maguire's lines came off a bit forced, which I noticed in the first film.  Franko is also a little stiff as Harry Osborne.  I didn't notice any bad acting, but nothing I would consider Academy-worthy either.  There was also a subplot about a physical problem with Parker that felt out of place in the film and wasn't developed very well.  But it made for some really incredible scenes that I wouldn't want removed.Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and accomplishes that rare feat of surpassing the original.  There were two or three specific events at the end of the movie that really blew me away and that I wasn't expecting, and will make for some very interesting sequels.  As a long-time Spider-Man fan, I can definitely say this movie is very fulfilling, and I would recommend it to audiences of any age and type.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the tone of the movie?", "id": "b2d36ea1a48da86761021b95cf166bca", "answers": [{"text": "The humor is very subtle", "answer_start": 947}, {"text": "up reading the comics religiously", "answer_start": 117}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JMUA", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I saw kill bill vol 2 last night and man was this a great movie.

Not what I expected.  I love it!  The ending was beautiful and filled with tensions between the bride(...)The movie is more on the love side than blood dringing battles that took place in vol 1.Vol1 had more action and less dialoug but when you watch vol 2 you will be like \"What vol 1?\".  This film is so(...) good I might see it again.Bride is back for her final cut as she has to kill her way until that last person is BILL.  She will encounter new enemies such as bud(Bills brother)who was once an assasin for the DivAs.  But now is a drunk who lives in a trailer.  The movie is also longer than vol 1.  Thats really a good thing..  The movie is filled with action that you wont be able to blink one eye....Ok yeah you can..  You also take a stroll around the park as you see how The Bride(...) Learned her techneek.  From her master who is very dissaplint at what he teaches, the bride will stop at nothing to get what she came to do.  The movies dialouge is the most important one of all.  So pure.  So good only Tarantino can give us this!  I won't spoil anything for you but I can assure you this.  Kill Bill volume 2 is a masterpiece.  It is very underated and for those who think its over rated get your hw and come back when you realize what you've been missing out on.  Original, Pure, The best.  I choose this as my 2004 film of the year!Final note......DO NOT!  I REPEAT!  DO NOT GET Vol 1 or vol 2 on dvd.  If alot of people know how Tarantino is you know one damn thing....There will always be some Collecters edition crap with lots of added footage and great behind the scene footage.  What I'm trying to say is there will probably be some 3 disc  collecters edition with the unrated/Directors cut filled with all the color and gore you can feed on.  And it will probably have some great footage.  Though I dont think vol 2 didn't have any violent things taken out since it's main purpose wasn't violence in vol 2.  Even though there is 200$ special edition box set in japan just wait for some collecters edition to hit US probably around the end of 2004 or sometime in 2005.

Not only has it lived up to the expectations from critics and audiences alike, but it has managed to be even better than the first, combining style and substance for a different, but ultimately just as satisfying, cinematic experience.In some aspects, Volume 2 is more a character study, as we begin to learn the unexpected personalities, histories, and different sides of characters that Volume 1 didn't have time to delve into. Backgrounds of major scenes like the Massacre at Two Pines are established, relationships between characters become more detailed, and the suspense begins to build as we as an audience are ultimately dying to know how the saga will come to a close.One of the many things that makes \"Kill Bill Vol.2\" great are the performances. As The Bride (you learn her name in this film), Uma Thurman gives a performance worthy of an Oscar, or at least a nomination. The best way I can think of to describe it is realistic, as she experiences a wide range of emotion in her role; pain, terror, anger, sadness, determination, joy, and in each she manages to convey it in a believable and honest way that is truly astounding to watch. David Carradine, as Bill, finally gets the screen time to showcase his talents, all delivered in an terrifying but somehow comforting quiet manner.In another amazing performance, Michael Madsen (Budd) has the ability to convey emotion with a single look in his eye or on his weathered face. Regret, sadness, but an undeniable, sadistic greed are played subtley and realistically here, and in my opinion, he also deserves a nomination for a supporting role. Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver is another performance not to be missed. She is truly, maniacally evil here, and seems to relish every moment of it. Also, Chia Hui Liu, as Pai Mei, the Bride's instructor, gives a small but delightful performance, providing a large portion of the humor in the film.Although \"Kill Bill Vol.2\" is more driven by its dialogue than its gory fight scenes, it has its share of amazing matchups, the most astounding (as many reviewers have already said) being that of the confrontation between the Bride and Elle Driver in Budd's sundrenched trailer. It is without a question one of the most amazing sequences I have ever witnessed, and one of my personal favorites in the Kill Bill movies.The creative direction in this film also deserves much praise. The transitions from black and white to color film adds a new dimension to the picture, and choice of light, intensity of sound, and cinematography, especially in the fight sequences, makes \"Kill Bill\" a visual delight. Blending the spaghetti westerns as a contrast to the old kung-fu flicks was a genius move as well.A fan of Tarantino's previous works or not, you must give credit where credit is due for the \"Kill Bill\" films. Each piece is essentially a work of art, where style and substance are beautifully combined for an original, humorous, and truly unforgettable experience.", "qas": [{"question": "What's the greatest scene?", "id": "72a034674c4cd6e0e810ba361073bf77", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JMUK", "paragraphs": [{"context": "When you think about a movie that is based on a serial killer, you could think &quot;how ordinary and overdone&quot;. It is about a woman named  Aileen Wuornos who was a prostitue, and winds up committing several murders (note that I did not refer to her as a serial killer). What makes this story different though, is the road that takes her there. This movie illicited a response from me that I had not expected which was a tremendous amount of sympathy and pity. Her life started out incredibly difficult, and only got worse. Unlike the other notables (John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, et al) in my opinion she was not crazy and was more or less driven to do what she did. The first murder that she committed was a &quot;John&quot; that was brutally raping her, and had planned on killing her. That was the one that opened the flood gates of rage. The rest were the product of a lifetime of abuse from, and hatred of all of the other &quot;Johns&quot; previous. Only one that I saw could be considered oppertunistic, and towards the end she actually has difficulty killing one of her last victims. If you had never heard of Aileen Wuornos before, this one will make you never forget her name.Along those same lines, Charlize Theron's performance was easily the best in her career, and she will likely be immortalized for her protrayal - and rightly so. While normally a incredibly beautiful bombshell, she had to gain thirty pounds, and go through an amazing transformation with only make up. The only prosthetics were used were fake teeth. She winds up looking nothing like herself, which makes it very easy to forget that it's really her.Coming from a guy who owns more than 500 titles, I consider this to be one of the best that I own.

After much deliberation, I've finally decided to review Roland Emmerich's \"The Day After Tomorrow\". I must admit I liked his work on \"Independence Day\". The special effects in that movie achieved the loftiest of heights, creating a truly mesmerizing experience that entertained even though the whole thing suffered under a slew of plot holes the size of the Titanic. Unfortunately, Emmerich decided to indulge his appetite for left-wing politics with \"The Day After Tomorrow\". The subject? Global warming, of course! It's the new religion for millions of idiots with sad lives who have nothing better to do with their time. I think the whole global warming phenomenon is a bunch of bunk, a pseudo-scientific con job bolstered with shoddy \"facts\" that appeals to the media due to its lurid, sensationalistic potentialities. This film does absolutely nothing to advance the idea of global warming. In fact, it probably hurts the cause in ways unanticipated by the director. Oh well. No global warming induced sweat off my brow. Of course, none of this means I wouldn't watch the film. I'll always give a mindless action flick a go, even when said flick reeks of far left-wing pabulum.I initially wept over the appearance of Dennis Quaid in the role of main character Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist (say that five times real fast) deeply concerned about warning signals he's receiving from Mother Nature. Then I decided to forgive him and just watch the movie. Hall claims that computers tell him that a new Ice Age is coming down the pike. He tries to warn people at some conference, but laughter essentially ushers him right out of the room. In films, laughing at leftists means disaster in the near future. And sure enough, weird stuff starts happening. Like what? Oh, the usual. Snow in warm climates, heavy winds knocking planes out of the sky, killer tornadoes wiping out Los Angeles, a tidal wave and freezing temperatures engulfing New York City, England icing over, massive super storms sending temperatures plunging in the northern half of the globe. Like I said, the usual. The special effects showing the disasters unfolding are pretty cool. I liked the reporter in L.A. dying horribly as a result of the tornadoes destructive power. I hope he believed in global warming. The New York scenes work well too, especially the tanker floating through the city streets. Pity about England, though.Anyway, enough talk about the effects. Emmerich, having heard something about \"characters\" and \"a story\" somewhere in his career, tries to pull at our heartstrings with myriad plot lines both big and small. For example, Jack Hall's precocious kid Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) just happened to head to the Big Apple before the weather took a turn for the worse. He'll spend most of his time trying to get fellow student Laura (Emmy Rossum) to warm up to him (pun intended) during the time they seek shelter in the New York City library. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward), a doctor by trade, spends her time weathering the disaster by taking care of a terminally ill cancer patient. Ian Holm shows up as a Scottish meteorologist long enough to turn the lights out in England. As for Jack, he foregoes helping the United States survive the storm in order to take a nice trek up to New York in order to save his estranged son. How heroic! How stupid! All sorts of threatening situations unfold, usually laughably, before this two-hour piece of propaganda shudders to a stop.  The conclusion plays around with the irony of Americans having to head to Mexico in order to survive the disaster. A[...] Ain't that a kick in the head!A laugh a minute, this \"The Day After Tomorrow\". It's less a film and more a collection of jaw dropping inconsistencies, cackhanded dialogue, and shock and awe special effects. I won't kid around about the effects--they're awesome and superbly rendered. The unfolding calamity is the only reason to watch the movie. The rest of what we see onscreen is, as my 8th grade science teacher used to say, dumber than a box of rocks. Are we really supposed to believe these super storms, the size of continents, could form this quickly? And why isn't the southern hemisphere affected in some way? How can the temperature drop to at least minus 150 degrees yet we see characters ambling around outside? How can you drive and walk from Washington, D.C. to New York City in these conditions, and do it in a matter of a few days? The answer to all these niggling questions, and others, is simply this: it's in the script. The almighty script trumps all manner of problematic plot holes. Maybe we should use copies of the script to plug the hole in the ozone layer, or provide shade for our rapidly warming planet. You got a better idea?If you're willing to turn your brain off before starting the DVD player, you'll probably make it through \"The Day After Tomorrow\" relatively unscathed. If you don't turn your brain off before watching, though, you risk serious and irreparable damage on such a scale that you'll resemble Al Gore for the rest of your life. Extras on the disc include a couple of commentaries from Emmerich and assorted personnel, a couple of deleted scenes that add nothing to the monstrosity we just watched, a sound demo, and a DVD-ROM featurette that I didn't bother to investigate. Not much for a \"blockbuster,\" but I see a double disc release has also come out. If you really like the film, pick that up instead. Lastly, an aside: Sela Ward is the most gorgeous woman on the planet. Her presence in the film eased some of the pain I felt from watching such a huge piece of misinformation.

Thankfully, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" has avoided this pitfall.  By working in enough real science, the director/writers allow the viewer to accept an otherwise unbelievable premise, and enjoy a special effects extravaganza with a surprising amount of heart.That premise is that fresh water pouring of the melting polar ice caps have disrupted  the Gulf Stream, which is responsible for North America's and Northern Europe's mild climates, causing the rapid onset of an Ice Age.  As I alluded to above, this is actually a fairly accepted scientific theory, and while the timeframe is far too compressed to have any foundation in reality (ice ages take hundred or thousands of years to develop) this plausibility is sufficient to make the movie enjoyable.Which is a good thing as the special effects are spectacular, and include tornados tearing apart Los Angeles, British helicopters falling out of the sky frozen solid, and the coup de grace, New York City being inundated and flash frozen.  That said, all of these bells and whistles would be for naught if it weren't for a good story, and the actors deliver a solid, if not spectacular  tale.In the best tradition of the post-apocalyptic genre, the story wisely starts out globally, narrows to a national focus, and then continues to spiral down to a few key characters who can place the unimaginable in some sort of digestible context.  In this case, the viewer follows Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has predicted the consequences of polar melting, as he fights the way through the storm in an effort to rescue his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trapped in New York with several of his friends.  This personalization of a global calamity is highly effective, as it clearly represents the most basic consequences of the calamity and represents similar efforts that would be going on all over the world.  As a bonus, the film also toys with modern norms, as Americans flood over the border into Mexico, which adds an additional point of reference for this vastly altered world.The DVD itself is solid if not spectacular.  The sound and image are both superb, and fully convey the experience of cutting edge special effects.  The disc also includes the usual deleted scenes (only two, which while perhaps to be expected with a special effects thriller, was somewhat disappointing) and commentaries.  Again, these are the usual, and really represent what would be the minimum standard for DVD releases; as such, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw a special edition release down the road, so that's something to keep in mind.All in all, \"The Day After Tomorrow\" is an enjoyable movie featuring superb effects, and a surprisingly good story.  It will particularly appeal to fans of the post-apocalyptic genre, as it pays tribute to several core themes of the genre.  However, it is easily appreciated as a thriller, and has a surprising amount of hear as well.Jake Mohlman", "qas": [{"question": "How's the effect?", "id": "902203bc48965c6a758067960cbe2b4e", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "If you were expecting this movie to be a repeat of Independence Day, you are sorely mistaken!

Maybe it's because the story, though at least engrossing on the surface level, lacks enough internal resonance to generate anything like 'meaning' or 'importance.'  Instead, as so often in American culture, importance is supposed to be implicitly assumed because people are waving guns around.Cruise, in his always polished and convincing manner, nevertheless spouts a lot of fake philosophical hooey about the cosmos and self-actualization, and we're supposed to listen seriously because (ready for this, folks?) he's a hit man (oooh), and he's got a gun (oh my).  Jamie Foxx's character can't live up to who he wants to be, until he finds the inner strength to (get this) fire a gun.

Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms.  Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a \"muscular nerd,\" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues.  Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in \"glamour\" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.Set in a small town in rural Idaho, \"Napoleon Dynamite\" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office.  Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge.  This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite \"fit in\" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the \"teen years.\"  One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy.  It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another \"Revenge of the Nerds,\" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations.  Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process.  It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them.  These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another.  As a result, \"Napoleon Dynamite\" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly.  Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world.  Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself.  As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.\"Napoleon Dynamite\" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it.", "qas": [{"question": "Do you have many friend?", "id": "0c9b36c892052752018e4f84f4e5f477", "answers": [{"text": "He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms", "answer_start": 270}]}]}, {"context": "Every character in this movie is flawlessly cast, and relatively unknown.

Thus, over the past couple years, an increasingly wistful, decidedly kitsche assimilation of the styles and media-motifs of the immediate-past has crept into the mass-consciousness, especially for those of the '00' youth, inexperienced and adrift on the ripple-shock tides of a simultaneous informational over-abundance and widespread social repression/reactionary meme in the wake of 9-11.  The ridiculous visual hubris and innocuous ignorance that seem intimately tied to the 70's and the 80's have become attractive to those seeking career revitalization (Gwen Stefani and Outkast being prominent recent examples) and for those wishing to ape a personal neo-retro style that, in equal measure quirky and twee, turns back from the sterile fashions of futurism, the devastating deconstruction of knowing too much, too soon (or, perhaps more truthfully, knowing too much and not nearly enough).  To wit: so chaotic and complex is our contemporary social animal, that retreating into golden-hued nostalgia, as propagated by VH1, is incredibly seductive to the scions of the Post-Cold War Information Era, a womb of unrepentant confidence and social ideal so sorely lacking in these trying times.  You know, back when our plutocratic-puppet president was actually a ~good actor~; back when men teased their hair with aplomb and were considered the macho quintessence; back when the cultural identity was safe, with easy pickings for either path of conformity or rebellion.  \"Things were better back then\" - which is all nonsense, of course, like most nostalgic reflection: despite the more fantastical Hollywood archive of the 70's and 80's, that era was plagued with just as much uncertainty and threatening factors as we are now: AIDS, Nuclear Holocaust, economic depression/inflation, Iran-Contra, corporation corruption and drug-addled inner city denizens...  The Grass is always Greener two decades past.Thus the timely release of *Napoleon Dynamite*, a movie that capitalizes on this retreat into the past, reveling in unabashed kitsche and resurrecting the hoary Revenge of the Nerd archetype within a firmly-80's teen-comedy structure.  The look of the film is carefully, meticulously crafted: fashion from the late 70's, video cassette players from the early 80's, the fake-organic interior decoration made popular in the 60's; complete with knick-knacks and kitsche of any era, including plastic green toy-soldiers and the random thrift-store sai.  Yet late-90's elements insinuate themselves into the film, defying our attempt to define it to this or that era: chat-rooms and the music of Jamiroquai and the Backstreet Boys inform the audience that the environment of *Napoleon Dynamite* is actually that of a time-warp Idaho local, past and present intrinsically woven via cultural artifacts, verbal expressions and the overall ambience of the film total, much like Wes Anderson's uber-quirky exegesis *The Royal Tenembaums*.  Past and the just-past merge; the threatening cloud of the future is utterly banished in this ugly-duckling fairy tale.  In this regard, I find *Napoleon Dynamite* to be a brilliant example of our retro-seduction, a borderline-exploitative wish fulfillment juggernaught with the ability to tempt the kitsche-craving of any age or temperament.And yet, as a film, I found Napoleon Dynamite sadly lacking, ineffectual as entertainment and about as deep as anything else stamped with the MTV seal of production, a somewhat boring affair that only incidentally rises above its trend-conglomeration ethic to produce a surprised chuckle.  Obviously I'm in the minority here, given the glowing reviews both on this page and from most mainstream critics; to give further example, this film was recommended to me from a high-school work associate who claimed he'd watched it four times in just two days.  It touched him, quite deeply, for reasons I suspect are congruent with my beginning-paragraph thesis.  I, however, struggled with this movie.  Napoleon himself is an unsympathetic caricature of the everyman geek; the fact that he so obviously \"lacks skills\" means that almost all comedic triggers associated with his actions and attitudes are a matter of laughing ~at~, rather than laughing ~with~.  Even worse, Pedro is the ultimate construction of a stereotype, tiptoeing around offensiveness.  Why does he want to be class president? Even Pedro doesn't know.  More interesting are Napoleon's brother, the grandmamma's boy seeking soul-mate status, and his uncle, a football-jock relic lost in the glory-days of `82.  Nearly all of those surprised chuckles I mentioned before stemmed from these two characters, but even they are not enough to sustain the movie as a whole.Now, it may seem that I'm being overtly harsh with this film, but I couldn't escape the notion that a good deal of *Napoleon Dynamite* was crippled by artistic laziness, an inescapable developmental ~complacency~ in regard to the core material.  Again and again, moments of potential humor lose substance; doubtless profound connotations are laid waste by the need to be clever.  This could have been a five-star classic, instead of the naval-gazing faux-indie anticlimax it ends up being.  Alas.I rate this movie three stars for its (un?) conscious attempt to epitomize the facile neo-retro trend that has so-far dominated '00'; its occasional moments of earned levity and undeniable clever faade; and for that final dance-sequence...dat boy has got some moovez, yo!", "qas": [{"question": "When can I attend the movie set?", "id": "077d0b290fcb85e4621d8b406ac45856", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JNC2", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Garden State is a bit of a dark horse.

I liked some aspects of this film very much.  Other parts gave me a bad case of the biopic blues.The flashbacks that depict Ray's childhood as a poor, fatherless boy living in Florida with his mother and his brother are wrenching and heartbreaking.  Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother Aretha, is a standout.  She is a formidable individual who rejects self-pity and never allows Ray to feel sorry for himself, even after he loses his sight.  CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.  I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Della Bea, a woman who stands by her man, although he betrays her time and time again.By now, most people know that Jamie Foxx will probably be Oscar nominated for his uncanny, dead-on performance as Ray Charles.  Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self-destructive drug habit.  For every moment of this film, Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Period.  The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get \"Hit the Road Jack\" out of my head.There were other portions of this film that irritated me.  Taylor Hackford bears much of the blame for some of the clunky and heavy-handed lines, and the absurd, over-the-top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.

How do you spell `Wow\" backwards? Sorry, that is an inside joke, a reference to my review of Christopher Nolan's \"Memento\", but an equally fitting reference to my feelings about Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of \"Batman Begins\".Ducard (Liam Neeson) waits for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a jail cell, somewhere in Asia. He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil. Arranging for his release, Ducard tells him how to find their camp. There, Wayne meets Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, \"The Last Emperor\"), the leader of the League of Shadows, a group of highly trained men determined to make the world a safe place. Upon completion of his training, Wayne travels back to Gotham and finds the city in a state of decay. His former girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is a District Attorney working to clean up the increasingly corrupt political system. She realizes that a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, \"28 Days Later\"), is transferring all of a local crime lord's (Tom Wilkinson) henchmen into his custody at Arkum Asylum. Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor. As Bruce announces his plans, Alfred becomes a confidant and assistant. Meeting Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), an inventor employed by Wayne Industries, Wayne begins to assemble the arsenal necessary for his transformation to Batman. As he begins to fight the evil in Gotham, he meets Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), perhaps the last honest cop in Gotham.I am a big fan of the Tim Burton \"Batman\" films, especially the first one. But Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\", \"Insomnia\") has created a whole new vision of the character. I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid. To me, the whole fun of watching the film versions is to witness the mythology of these characters. Some of the characters, like Batman, Superman and Spider Man, have been in our culture for so long they have reached the level of myth. Who doesn't know at least a little of the story of Superman's creation? Or Batman's? In \"Batman Begins\", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego.Fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace. A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us. Isn't this what all directors should do? But how many are successful? This is a tribute solely to the writer and director. As we watch Wayne go through his training, Nolan inserts flashbacks to Wayne's childhood, giving us a glimpse of the fears that have so far shaped his life. The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him. Upon his return to Wayne Manor, the other characters enter the picture and we learn about them. This is one of the best things about the film; there is so much going on. Just because the film is about a comic book superhero, Nolan didn't feel it necessary to dumb down the plot or the characters or make it simplistic. This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.There is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film. Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life. In one scene, Alfred explains that Wayne needs to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy, if he wants to divert attention from his alter ego. Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat. Alfred becomes less a butler and more a confidant to Wayne, more so than in any other incarnation of the story. And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.The look of the film is also fantastic. Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place. Thankfully, they didn't use CGI to recreate everything, as they did in \"Star Wars Episode III\". It is my understanding that Chicago provided the backdrop for Gotham, with embellishments created by CGI. When you see it, you will understand why this is so important. Obviously, there is a significant amount of CGI work involved, but using a real backdrop gives the setting a quality that has been lacking in other films lately. All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable. Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.Christian Bale is a really good actor. One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting. You might not like the character, or the film, but at least they were interesting. As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works. Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part. He is also able to inject humor and a lighthearted quality, at times, making the character three dimensional and interesting. When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.Let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Liam Neeson isn't going to be bad. And \"Begins\" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise. The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously. Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions. I know I sound like a broken record, but because they believe, we believe.Michael Caine, in particular, stands out. This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film. The moment I learned that he had been cast to play Alfred, I was very excited. It is such perfect casting. In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before. Alfred has invested so much of his life in this family that he deeply cares about their legacy. This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.Cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted. Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story. Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish. There is no trace of his accent. Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.The story, as mentioned before, is very detailed. Towards the end, there are a few plot twists which surprised me. And I am almost never surprised by plot twists. They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.Nolan also manages to keep the film dark, much like Film Noir, without going too far over the edge. Gotham is drenched in shadow, the streets riddled with crime. The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor. As the villain's plan begins to unfold, the story becomes darker and may be too intense for little children. For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more... you, know, believable.There are some terrific action sequences throughout the film. In a couple, as Batman fights the bad guys, the scenes are presented in a unique, almost impressionistic fashion. A glimpse of Batman rappelling down, a shot of thugs getting their heads knocked together, a brief look at another crook flying into the air with Batman. This is a unique idea. Generally, we see every fist hitting flesh, every cut, every ounce of blood spilling. In \"Begins\", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details. This idea works really well.The film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time. Again, rather impressionistic, the opening credits suggest rather than inform.Generally, I can't stand the thought of a sequel. Can't anyone do anything original in Hollywood?

Caine is remarkable as Alfred, Neeson was outstanding in another one of his \"mentor\" roles - he might just get typecast if he keeps accepting such roles - Freeman is breathtaking as Fox, he doesn't have to say much, yet he owns the screen. Gary Oldman created a whole new him; a cross between Tom Skeritt & Edward James Almos plus a little extra. Katie Holmes, what can we say, she's all grown up now & can act too, good for her.

I had to get that out after watching two pieces of crap that called themselves Batman. Joel Schumacher's reign of terror is over and Christopher Nole has taken the helm of the Dark Knight's latest project, Batman Begins. A tremendous improvement (how could it be worse than Jim Carry stealing the scenes or George in a nippled Batsuit?) over the last two and even grabs some ground from the gothic creations of Tim Burton, the original Batman and Batman Returns.This story, like everyone knows, tells how Bruce Wayne went from the orphened son of a multi-billionare to the Dark Knight, avenging his parent's deaths and fighting crime in Gotham City. It begins in the Far East where Bruce learns how to disappear into the night and fight his enemies. While CNN found this a stupid beginning and too \"Asian-martial artsy\", I thought there was no better place to begin. I mean, Batman's entire technique is the night, a concept used by those steathy assassin/spies called ninjas. Also, you can't expect Batman to take boxing lessons to beat people up; no, you've gotta go martial arts for that.Moving along, Bruce returns to Gotham, transformed from a Corescant-like wonder of dazzling heights and glimmer into a dark, Blade Runner-like LA, topped off with a island housing the poor, criminally insane, and modeled after a destroyed Hong Kong slum. In Gotham, we get the beginnings of Batman from Lucius Fox, a former board member of Wayne Enterprises played by Morgan Freeman, and the butler Alfred, played by the wonderfully English Michael Caine. However, Batman will find his troubles in the psychologically minipulative Dr. Crane, played by sinister Cillian Murphy, also known as The Scarecrow for the mask he wears. Crane uses a hallucinogen that induces horrifying day-mares which render the victim helpless in their own fear.Speaking of fear, this movie uses psychological fear to a greater extent than any superhero movie, actually more than most movies, I've ever seen. The Scarecrow isn't really scary (well, maybe the mask is a little odd, possibly frightening to younger audiences), but he doesn't need to be psychotic or powerful to induce fear, he uses your own. Bruce's own fears of the past (not to mention guilt over his parents' deaths) provide a much more humane look at a superhero, like that of Spiderman 2. You feel Bruce is human, rather than just a symbol, as he attempts to be as Batman.Overall, this film plays much better than the last two, possibly all, of the Batman's before. The cast is excellent (never seen one better for superhero films), the dialogue is witty (unlike the final Star Wars movie), and the plot is a great start to the Batman canon. The end leaves us with Batman, the new vigilante of Gotham, ready to take on the crime of the city, one villian at a time (and ready to find the REAL murderer of his parents, the Joker, who leaves his trademark card at the end).", "qas": [{"question": "How is the cast?", "id": "0cb6cf2fe92bc89cf19c2affeee8d3d7", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I think the best thing to come from the Renaissance of Superhero films is to be less tongue-in-cheek with the characters and show them just how extreme a real-life personality has to be to want to live the life.  We've seen it in \"Daredevil\" and we've seen it in the \"Blade\" series.  We've seen people who'd rather be \"Normal\" forced into the life through mere genetics in the \"X-Men\" films and we've seen a guy become a hero out of never-ending guilt in \"Spider-Man.\"  Now, we see the fully-developed psychological reasons why Bruce Wayne, a man who has all the privileges of being white, rich, and gifted, would choose to live what amounts to a freak's life.Nolan and Goyer took what Tim Burton did in \"Batman\" and did it one better.  Rather than giving us an artistically \"dark\" vision as to who the character is and what makes him tick, they decided to give us a plausibly \"real-world\" look into what a Gotham City would be like, right down to the gritty corruption that consumes it.  We also get to see just how long it took for Bruce Wayne to become \"Batman,\" right down to where he almost takes the other road and blow away the man who murdered his parents.Christian Bale - not my first choice to play Wayne, but one can't have a really big name wear the suit.  It's been proven - if a \"superstar\" wears the suit, then we don't see the character.  (Unless, the actor is tailor made for the role, a la Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier, or someone transcends expectations, like Michael Keaton did in the first \"Batman\")  He delivered a dark, fatalistic Batman, as well as a flighty-but-never-fey millionaire playboy \"Bruce Wayne.\"  You get the feeling with Bale that the real Bruce Wayne DID die those long years ago along with his parents.  I got a sense of doom from him the moment he decided to become Batman, and that is the core of the character - the REAL \"person\" is Batman.  \"Bruce Wayne\" has become a mask.  As it should be.All told, this was the Batman that had to be, apart from the first Dini animated series.  Thank God for the Goyers and Nolans of this world.  They both did this character, and the character's long, storied, history, the justice it deserved.", "qas": [{"question": "How was this one film?", "id": "f09afc7b8166663f3dd646b75ada4f42", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Rarely does a movie live up to its hype.  This is one of the exceptions.If you didn't catch this movie in theatres buy it now.  It's not only as good as you've heard, it's actually even better.  For the first time, a Batman film has succeeded completely in capturing all of the elements of the fabled comic book character while also producing a Batman that seems fully grounded in reality.Let's face it, though the Tim Burton Batman movies have a large and devoted following, those movies are ultimately less about the Dark Knight and more about Burton's ongoing fascination with offbeat characters and the bizarre.  Joel Schumacher's \"Batman Forever\" was an enjoyable if overly campy romp but by \"Batman & Robin\" this series had collapsed under the weight of too many villains, sidekicks, and corny dialogue.  It's telling that on the recent DVD special edition of that film even Schumacher admits that movie stunk and issues a public apology for running this series into the ground.This meant that \"Batman Begins\" director Chris Nolan had a hell of a task on his hands when he took the reins of this film:  Deliver a Batman film for the 21st Century and restore credibility to the character.The idea of going back to the character's origins was a master stroke and serves the story well.  Here we get the most detailed on-screen documentation of Batman's beginnings ever shown and damned if it all doesn't come off as more than a little epic.  Much credit must also go to Christian Bale in the title role.It helps that Bale is the first Batman who is diesel enough to play the role without the benefit of a muscled, rubberized suit.  Seriously, you could probably crack walnuts on this guy's abs.It helps that he also looks good in a tuxedo.  The whole appeal of Batman was always that as Bruce Wayne by day, he was the biggest playboy this side of James Bond.  But by night he was an obsessive revenge freak bent on striking at criminals from the shadows.  Bale's got the acting chops and the look to nail this in a minute.The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast.  While much of the pre-release publicity on this point went to the future Mrs. Tom Cruise, Katy Holmes, the real standout performances come from Michael Caine as Alfred, Wayne's stalwart Butler, Gary Oldman as the Gordon, one of Gotham's last honest cops and the city's future police commissioner, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, an inventor who helps equip Wayne for his war on crime.One thing that is a holdout from the earlier Batman films is that the movie features two villains, in this case criminal mastermind Ras Al Ghul and Scarecrow.  But where this detracted from Batman in the earlier films, it works here because Nolan keeps the story centered where it ought to be, on the Dark Knight.Granted these aren't exactly A-list Batman baddies but \"28 Days Later\"'s Cillian Murphy imbues Scarecrow with just enough serpentine evil to make him a major player.Hardcore Batfans will of course know that Ras Al Ghul, though not a household name, is depicted in the comics as the Caped Crusader's most dangerous adversary.  As the head of centuries-old criminal empire with ties to all levels of government and organized crime, he's the Batman universe equivalent of Keyser Sose.  The movie gets this exactly right and you're likely to be thrown by a nifty twist involving this character.If there's one complaint about this movie it's that it's perhaps too long.  But this is perhaps expected given that movie not only introduces Bruce Wayne/Batman, his entire supporting cast, two villains, and lays out a plot to destroy Gotham by driving its citizens mad.Still this movie is a treat and stands along with Sam Raimi's Spiderman films as the new benchmark by which all superhero films will be measured.So now that DC is shown that they can get Batman right on film and is getting ready roll out a new Superman next year, how about they drop the Caped Crusader and Man of Steel fixations and greenlight movies based on some of their other cool characters.A Flash movie would be awesome if done right and, speaking of \"greenlighting\" where's that long-discussed Green Lantern flick.Come on DC!

It is a great story of origins, as well as of character. The film is full of quotes that tell you who Batman is and what he is about: such as Alfred's \"Why do we fall - so we can learn to pick ourselves up;\" or Rachel's \"It's not who you are underneath - it's what you do that defines you,\" which Batman later repeats about himself; or Batman's \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you,\" which he speaks to Liam Neeson's character right before his demise. Batman Begins is a well-defined story about a well-defined character that is both uplifting and meaningful.I also think Christian Bale is the definitive Batman. Batman is about the costume, the \"muscle,\" the eyes, the mouth and the voice. Christian Bale has all of that. Plus, he makes a great Bruce Wayne and has the best Alfred you could possibly ask for - Michael Caine; the perfect Rachel to be sweet on - Katie Holmes; a terrific Jim Gordon to work with - Gary Oldman; and the added character of Lucius Fox, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. Wayne Manor and the Batcave are both perfect. Only the Batmobile may disappoint some die-hard fans because it doesn't LOOK like the Batmobile - but it is fun. You've got the perfect nemesis in Liam Neeson, and the perfect Scarecrow in Cillian Murphy. Everything is perfect. I gave the film 5 out of 5 stars.Now enter The Dark Knight.Why is it that directors and producers think Batman is about the villains - it's not. They are merely the foils off which Batman plays. Tim Burton's series featured one villain in the first film - the Joker, played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson. Then he started stacking villains and super heroes, so that, by the end of the series, there was very little room left for Batman. In the fourth film, Batman And Robin, for which Burton was not actually responsible - he was canned as director after Batman Returns, and as producer after Batman Forever - there was Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and a host of others. Dark Knight has the Joker and Two-Face, and that's one too many, because it adds an additional 45 minutes to the film that kills the momentum and has the audience squirming in their seats. Dark Knight should just have been about Batman and his attempts to defeat the Joker.The Joker is supposed to be funny, in a warped sort of way. In Dark Knight, he is not, nor does he even try to be. So, really, it is not the Joker but a Joker-like character that appears in the film. Since Nolan wrote the script, he can be blamed for that. He doesn't seem to understand the Joker. Heath Ledger is playing a psychopath wearing bad make-up. That is not who the Joker is. Jack Nicholson had a far better take on the Joker, more reflective of the DC Comics character.Heath Ledger was not a great actor. But the fact that he is dead, and died at the end of this filming - probably because of the strain placed on him playing the Joker - makes him something of a curiosity. That, in my opinion, is the only reason Dark Knight is doing as well as it is at the box office and with critics. Once the DVD comes out, I seriously doubt if it will sell as well as Batman Begins because, by then, people will have had time to think about it. It's not a great film. It is a good film, but it has some major problems - besides the length, which is almost three hours. What does Ledger actually do in Dark Knight that could be interpreted as acting other than lick his lips so many times that it becomes annoying? He's playing a crazy man. How hard can that be? Mel Gibson made a career out of playing crazy people. It's not that difficult. The Joker character should be more than that.Batman Begins was a straight-forward story about origins and character, and was full of memorable quotes. The Dark Knight is a convoluted story about what we can become if we focus too long on darkness. Duh. The only memorable quote from the film is Harvey Dent's comment that is later taken up by Batman: \"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" Dent actually fulfills his own prophecy, but Batman, luckily, does not. But it's an idiotic quote that history has easily disproved. And that is enough to hang a plot on? At the end of the film, when Two-Face has been stopped and Commissioner Gordon is trying to explain to his son, and to us, what has just happened, it is a tangled mess of meaningless ideas that is drowned out by the blaring music. Nolan dug himself into a hole and he could not, for the life of him, explain his way out of it.In addition to the convoluted story and web of empty themes, the actress playing Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a poor and homely substitute for Katie Holmes. One wonders what Nolan and his casting director were thinking - even though she gets killed off, which is some consolation. I guess that opens the door for Catwoman. Everyone else in the cast is good; but Nolan gave them less to work with this time around than he did previously. Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent, who later becomes Two-Face, is the second major focus of the film after the Joker. What a mistake to have two scene-stealers in the same film, so that Christian Bale as Batman is really playing third fiddle.Here's a clue as to how good Dark Knight is as compared to Batman Begins: when I came out of Batman Begins, people were excited and raving to each other about the film, like they had been to a wedding or a sporting event. I watched their faces as they came out of Dark Knight: they were solemn and quiet, like they had been to a funeral. THAT tells me a lot. Something died in Dark Knight. Was it the series? I'm not looking forward to the third film because I have a good idea what is going to happen. (I hear Bale has a three-film contract, so it is inevitable.) If Nolan's third film is as stacked against Batman as this one was, if it is as convoluted, if the themes are as meaningless and the story as empty, there will be no dead actor to draw people to the box office - hopefully. Nolan is going to have to do some soul-searching, in my opinion, if he is going to recapture the magic of Batman Begins.Waitsel Smith", "qas": [{"question": "How would you compare the plot to those of Spielberg's  dinosaurs and Ridley Scott's aliens?", "id": "f6e10109ff49a0eb0d7a46ccb17dd2a1", "answers": [{"text": "Batman Begins", "answer_start": 3}]}]}, {"context": "This movie was so darn good I don't even know where to start.  Batman is the \"dark knight\" for a reason.  Something that hollywood apparently never decided to notice until two comic book geeks themselves (writer David S. Goyer and director Chris Nolan) were given the reigns to the best comic hero ever.  This movie is phenomenal.  It is the truest, and in my mind, the only, representation of Batman to ever hit the big screen.  What does it do that the others don't?  Many things.First of all, Batman Begins tells the story of Bruce Wayne.  It doesn't just start him out as some aristocratic loverboy heir like every other movie seemed hellbent on doing.  This movie lets us know Bruce Wayne BEFORE we know Batman.  Knowing the man behind the mask is half the fun when it comes to superheroes and costumed figures.  Without knowing an individual's inspiration for his actions, we're left to just think, \"wow, this guy is some superhuman weirdo,\" but this has never been the case with Bruce Wayne.  He is a normal (albeit extremely wealthy and intelligent) human being.  He has no superpowers except his mind and his friends.  He is a person.  Goyer and Nolan captured this perfectly with Batman Begins.Secondly, Batman as Batman is more fun than ever before.  Christian Bale is absolutely perfect for both the role of Bruce and Batman.  He is an extremely talented actor who has honed his chops on brooding/buff roles in many of his previous films (see Equilibrium for example...it's basically Batman) and it shows.  Christian brings a life and funness to Batman that was never really there because none of the others actors who have ever played him even knew who Batman was supposed to be.  Christian's Batman is distraught, he's enraged, he's new to the game, and he's fresh and excited to be out doing what he thinks is good.  Bale nails Batman, which lets Batman be the Batman all us comic fans have been craving.Finally, not only does this film have an absolutely stellar cast, but it has an amazing plot and great action scenes.  Finally, a story that is interesting, intriguing, and worthy of being turned into a movie.  And for all the comic action fans out there, there is action that is (for the most part) believable and very entertaining.  Of course the Tumbler could probably never really drive on roofs, but come on, it's fun and it actually goes with the plot really well!

It is also from this quest that he acquires the knowledge and skills necessary for him to become a warrior, ready and able  to combat the ills  and rid his town Gotham of all evil-doers.Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" is a more macho, masculine film than were the previous movies, which is not to take anything away from Tim Burton's elegiac, gothic and visionary takes on this story. But Burton's world is/was/ and will always be the world of the dreamer: his Batman is more sinned against than sinning.

It's interesting to note that in the previous Batman films we had big beautiful bombshells like Kim Bassinger and Nicole Kidman as the so-called love interests while here, in Nolan's vision we have a more scrubbed clean, working class (Rachel is an assistant D.A.) heroine: a woman who is as interested in righting wrongs as is Batman and not merely someone meant as an adornment to the suave debonair Batman of Val Kilmer, George Clooney or Michael Keaton. It's an important and telling shift from woman as a plush toy to one who is, not only beautiful but also smart and dedicated to a cause other than self-promotion and self-satisfaction.Christian Bale's Batman is real..i.e. a genuine, fleshed-out, beautifully written movie character: he is conflicted, he makes mistakes, he trusts the wrong people at times and he pays for his mistakes. It is a remarkable casting coup to have Bale in this role particularly since of late he has been playing a spate of radicals...i.e. in \"The Machinist,\" in which he transforms himself into a skeleton...literally. As Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bale dons the mask, assumes the persona, not out of a lust for power but out of a fervent belief that good will always triumph over evil: several times in this film he is brought to task for his trust in the basic goodness of people and one of his mentors ( Liam Neeson as Ducard) even goes so far as to ridicule Bruce as sentimental and weak for it. Though Ducard is his mentor and sensei, this relationship proves to be fraught with ambiguity as the movie progresses to the climax.What is a Batman film without its villains? But this film is devoid of the cartoon craziness of the Riddler or the Joker. Here we have Cillian Murphy (so good in \"28 Days Later\") as a scary-as-hell The Scarecrow, alias psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, who spews his  psychedelic paranoia and psychosis on an unsuspecting Gotham. His \"stuff\" is more thrilling and frightening than anything that the aforementioned villains could ever muster.\"Batman Begins\" is not only a physically gorgeous film, it is also an emotionally and ideologically complicated one. It wears its heart on its sleeve, yes...but it also has the brains and a profoundly strong back and pumped up physicality to back it up.", "qas": [{"question": "Does this movie  is free of artifacts of the type you find in old film?", "id": "06892da758449e156a8efd9bd731386e", "answers": [{"text": "beautifully written movie character", "answer_start": 1895}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JNOG", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Don't get me wrong.

Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater.

Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called \"The King\" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome.

However, it just didn't have any \"wow\" factor.The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.

The trailer looked so promising that one logically assumed that the rest of the film would be just as good. Not the case here. This movie should have been titled \"Tom Cruise's relationship with his 2 children, with a minor subplot involving some alien spaceships trying to destroy mankind.\" But that wouldn't bring in the big bucks, now would it?This movie feels like a rough draft of a better, more cohesive movie. The best words I can think of to describe it are flat, uninspiring and oftentimes, downright dull. So much time is spent on Tom and Dakota hiding in basements that one actually forgets that this movie is about aliens attacking. And when the action finally gets going, we simply don't care. In fact one scene shows the alien tripods firing their weapons from a large distance away. How are we, the audience, supposed to get involved in it? And towards the end it shows the city of Boston demolished, and yet we never get to see it. We're only shown the aftermath. Another rip-off. The only worthwhile action sequence was the first one, when the aliens appear out of the ground and begin vaporizing people and cleaning house. This scene is worth the price of admission. If only the other action scenes were as good. Not that I'm one of those moviegoers who can only like a movie if it has non-stop action. I appreciate a good plot to go along with it. But \"War of the Worlds\" only offers a paper-thin plot.In terms of acting, no standout performances here. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise...adequate, but nothing extraordinary. Dakota Fanning, whom I've liked in other movies, is simply annoying here. Most of her \"acting\" consists of screaming, crying, and staring bug-eyed into the camera. Tim Robbins steals the show although he is wasted. It makes me wonder what this movie would have been like if he had taken on the lead role.Oh yeah, and let's not forget about the cliches. Case in point, when Cruise is constantly able to walk away from disasters completely unharmed while almost everyone else is killed. The worst cliche for me came when the snake-like alien device was searching for humans in the basement. I was thinking to myself, \"any second now Dakota Fanning is going to knock over a tin can or make another mistake and cause the alien to turn back and look for them again.\" Sure enough, that's exactly what happened.I could go on but I won't. This movie was simply a let-down. It's the equivalent of seeing a nice tall cold glass of soda on a hot summer day, gulping it, only to discover that it's been sitting for days and is flat. But you can't spit it out since you've already swallowed it.If you must see a movie with a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration, watch \"Minority Report\" instead.

It isn't just drawing on the imagery or providing a parallel to the political situation [as you might find in Episode III or Batman Begins], I think this movie is a full-on processing of 9/11, in the only way you can currently make a movie about 9/11: using metaphor and indirection.Certain elements are directly parallel: from visuals of buildings collapsing, airplanes fallen from the sky, walls lined with \"missing\" posters, and especially the snowfall of ash and clothes that occurs during several scenes, to thematic elements, such as the question of whether it is preferable to seek revenge although it would mean more deaths, or simply to attempt to survive in the aftermath. There is talk about how an \"occupation never works,\" and Tom's son is doing a paper on the French occupation of Algeria. Later in the film, Tom has to try to convince his son not to join the Army, as it would be throwing his life away in a pointless war. Yep, you got 9/11, and it's right there on your movie screen.I happened to be on vacation the week of 9/11, returning five days after the attack, while the rubble was still burning. I didn't see the attack in person, but I saw the walls of \"missing\" posters, precisely as depicted in this film. You could literally feel the psychic tension increase the closer you came to downtown. Me and several of my friends reported suddenly bouts of crying happening at least once an hour. I worked in a building nearby that summer, and saw the pile of rubble from the towers that looked just like a big dump--until I saw a tiny person at the base of that pile, and realized that that pile of rubble was at least 10 stories high. I watched the attacks on television as they happened. The amazing thing was that they looked SO MUCH like special effects. I had no idea that the special effects I had been watching were so realistic! I had to turn off the TV after a very short time, because the more I watched it, the less real it became. One of the few moments that seemed real was when the second tower was collapsing, but the news commentator, possibly because of some technological delay, wasn't commenting on it yet.As I watched War of the Worlds, I kept thinking \"Why would someone, especially anyone who was in New York around 9/11, want to watch this?\" I think the answer comes in the form of one of Hitchcock's cardinal rules for creating suspense: that the audience should identify with the main characters--but not too much. He believed that it is crucial that the audience remain aware, on some level, that they are sitting safely in an auditorium watching a movie. The incredibly intense experience of watching imagery so familiar from the 9/11 while safely eating popcorn in an air-conditioned movie theater is powerfully cathartic. It allows us New Yorkers a way to process the terror and confusion we felt--from a safe distance.When I was a video clerk at a Borders Books and Music store, I remember looking at a video that included the famous footage of the Kennedy assassination. The copy on the back of the box said something to the effect of: \"Relive the horror of that terrible tragedy again and again!\"I thought this movie was incredible. The sheer precision of the direction was amazing. As I was watching it, it occurred to me that Spielberg truly is heir to Hitchcock in terms of his skill at telling a story by purely visual means, the economy and efficiency of his shots and editing, and how he is able to make a story exciting almost entirely through technique. That this story involves the inclusion of several very complex effects only makes his technical achievement that much greater.Spielberg very cannily keeps his special effects--and these are the very best special effects money can buy--in the periphery of most shots, which very effectively ups their realism and the sense of their integration with the characters. For example, one shot shows Cruise looking up, while we see the approaching alien ship reflected in the windshield of the car next to him. Contrast this to something like The Day After Tomorrow, in which you have the special effects shots and the character reaction shots, which are usually two very separate things.Many reviewers have picked out the mysterious fact that the one car Tom picks out magically works, when all of the others don't. Upon seeing this movie again, I see that there is an explanation for this. That is the car that Tom suggested a way to fix to the mechanic, and presumably the mechanic fixed it while the first tripod was appearing. This also explains why Tom knew to go right to that particular car. It's almost charming that Spielberg thinks that most people will be paying attention to this, particularly when distracted by mass scale destruction! Nevertheless, this doesn't explain the miraculous way the car survives without a scratch when a jet airliner crashes and destroys and entire neighborhood.One of the sequences I have seen derided as being lugubrious or somewhat pointless is the scenes in which Tom and Dakota hole up in the basement with Tim Robbins. Sure, Tim may be getting a little comfortable in his nutso basement dweller routine, but I think that this section contains THE most critical content of the movie, and that is its critique of the way politics have played out in the post-9/11 world. Outraged that the aliens should DARE to attack humans [it's just not right!], Tim, with his single shotgun, is under the delusion that the humans can rise up and show these aliens a thing or two. He has no plan except for the righteousness of his desire to stand up. Tom has to stop him, as he knows that if Tim makes a sound, he [and Tom and his daughter] will be instantly killed. Not to mention that it wouldn't accomplish anything. I think this creates a fairly compelling parallel with the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war... How many of us, if we could go back, wish we could choose not to pursue a course of senseless retaliation that has done nothing but destroy a country and kill more than 1,500 of our troops? At least the Tim character, in the movie, wants to retaliate against someone who actually attacked him.Many of my favorite critics have lauded the technique of this film, but ultimately decided that it is minor Spielberg. I disagree. I think this is major Spielberg in virtually every sense. If you buy into my 9/11 interpretation, it is an important film. It is certainly an emotionally powerful film and a technically masterful film. It has been quite a while since I have been so completely overwhelmed by a movie. In allowing viewers to reprocess the terror and confusion of 9/11 from the safety of their seats, and placing it within a context that can be thought about without the crazed emotional outbursts that prevent the real issues that arise from the attacks from being discussed, it's almost as though he has delivered us a nationwide therapy session.", "qas": [{"question": "Where is my kid?", "id": "27cdd2307812ddccfc876936e2c2ce5e", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I tried to view this movie with an open mind and had great hopes for it when it began.

I just wanted them out of the way so I could concentrate on the ferocious action going on all around them.  If those aliens had gotten a better look at this family, I think they would have been less envious, as claimed by Morgan Freeman's opening salvo.  Throwing wacky Tim Robbins into the mix was just asking for trouble.  What this movie needed was less After School Special melodrama and more Sci-fi adventure.  I wanted to see more scenes like the speeding train on fire or the night it rained clothes.  Even worse, the end just silently fizzled with but a brief glimpse of Gene Barry & Ann the screamer Robinson.  That ending couldn't have been more dismissive.Still, for all the cool bits, like the airplane strewn all over, and the pesky aliens exploring the basement, this film has just enough rudimentary excitement to make it almost worth having to view the worst family in the neighborhood running amok.

However, every so often, a really good or really bad movie comes along truly worthy of the extra effort. This movie falls into the latter, really bad, category.Absolutely everything Tom Cruise does in this movie appears faked or contrived. When he acts like he's crying, it appears fake. When he is acts afraid, it appears fake. When he is acts angry, it appears fake. Based on his performance in this movie alone, one can only reasonably conclude this man just cannot act.At the same time, Spielberg seems utterly incapable of producing a believable movie. According to this Spielberg movie, the first thing one wants to do when the aliens show up in town is to literally fight to get aboard a slow moving, brightly lit, ferry boat with absolutely no means of escape. Utterly absurd. Since the premise is so unbelievable, I suspect they actually included this segment in the movie simply to have an opportunity to show a special effect sequence of a ferry sinking. Many other segments in the movie were just as unbelievable.While this movie is somewhat more true to HG Wells story than previous movies, it deviates from the book in several significant regards - including a disturbing murder by the lead character played by Tom Cruise. And, again bowing to nationalism like prior movies, the location was once again changed to the USA instead of London.There is very little about this movie I liked. The child playing Tom Cruise's daughter, looks and talks like a much older midget (with little demonstrated acting ability). The child playing Tom Cruise's son, looks like a vagrant or tramp (with an attitude problem). Neither of these children in the movie act like normal children their age, nor like children might act in this situation (how children do act in similar scary situations).Finally, based perhaps on the notion that nearly half the families in America end in divorce, it appears Spielberg (like so many other directors today) was simply compelled to feature a dysfunctional family in this movie instead of one more like the other half of the families in America. Just once, I would like to see a modern movie featuring a healthy family my own can identify with.If you're a Cruise or Spielberg fan, your standards are perhaps low enough for you to probably like this movie. However, if you're a science fiction or War of the Worlds fan, this movie will likely fall far short of your expectations.

H. G. Wells' classic tale of alien invasion as seen through the eyes of one American family fighting to survive it, is a great novel however this movie did not do justice to the book, the 50's version seemed to be better explained, had a better plot & was fairly clear-cut.The movie on principal was flawed. Like why didn't the \"invaders\" start their \"blood sucking\" exercise earlier on in the movie instead of blowing up all those people to smithereens & wasting that entire valuable food source? How come after the Electromagnetic pulse hit the city/country one guys' camcorder captured everything??? Here is a brief history on EMP. EMP is a high-intensity, short-duration burst of electromagnetic energy. Although the electric field created from an EMP lasts for only a short time, its effects can be devastating. Electrical systems connected to things that can conduct current like wires, antennas, and metal objects will suffer significant damage. EMP effects on electronics include interference of radio frequency links, irreparable damage to microcircuits, and even the disabling of satellites. So how come a seasoned sci-fi filmmaker like Spielberg not know that.This was supposed to be a contemporary retelling of H.G. Wells' seminal novel, the film turned into a sci-fi adventure thriller with no meaning what-so-ever. Besides in true Hollywood / summer movie fashion; I expected Tom Cruise to save the world, revive any resistance to the aliens & salvage whatever was left of this planet, instead he is just an average Joe struggling to stay alive with the backdrop being the extraordinary battle for the future of humankind it.Verdict: Not what you'd expect from Spielberg, nor what you'd expect from Cruise, however the special effects, graphics etc... is the only thing that meets what we've come to expect & anticipate in a Spielberg movie.

However... fact is, the movie was silly when it first came out, this version is just as silly.It's more of the same, except this time the Aliens are coming from underground in thier big tripods'o'doom instead of flying around in spaceships.

In fact, Cruise doesnt even know that much about his kids but he takes him in and soon after he does, in the sky the weather kinda is a little screwy, Cruise saying: \"That's weird, the wind is pushing towards the storm\".

The machine kills the people around them turning them into dust, clothes fly, Cruise flees back to his house where he takes his kids on a little road trip where they try to make it to Boston so they can get to their mom. Disaster strikes even more when the machines multiply and ever city isnt safe from their deadlt onslaught. Fun, Fast remake of the original has some pretty good moments, especially when the machines attack.

That film is 2005's adaptation of \"The Fantastic 4.\" The characters are one dimensional, and the plot is paper thin. I can sum it up as this: 5 scientists go into space and come back with super powers. Four of them decide to become superheroes, and one decides to become a super villain. And then, they fight. That's it. It doesn't even attempt to understand why four people, upon receiving these powers decide they should be super heroes. They do it because that's what people with super powers do, and of course they have a closet full of pre-made superhero costumes that were conveniently written into the plot as being \"next generation astronaut suits.\" Yeah, ruddy brilliant guys.There is a sub plot in there about Ben Grim being unhappy with his monstrous new appearance as \"The Thing,\" but the way the writers chose to resolve it ultimately feels ridiculous. Also, Dr. Doom, who is one of the most prolific recurring villains in the entire Marvel universe, is completely neutered in this movie. Comparing this Dr. Doom to his comic book counterpart is like comparing Chad Vader to his big brother Darth. The movie was obviously made in a boardroom of Fox executives trying to figure out how to get as many teenage boys into the theater as possible, because it is also chock full of frivilous extreme sports footage, special effects shots, and meticulously airbrushed women.The only good thing I can say about this movie was that it looked good on Blu-Ray, at a time when I barely had anything to watch in HD. If you're looking for a movie to demo your new home theater with though, there are dozens of movies that look just as good if not better in HD, that aren't textbook examples of what happens when movies get made in by business men.", "qas": [{"question": "What was the effect?", "id": "cc8c93ef2dee8a649472e72551f8a7c5", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I was gonna listen to the bad reviews and not see this movie. That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always  planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disapointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman  movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like.I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work.Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does ok too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisable compared to his love for science. So she gets invisable powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literly goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off.Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powes as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job  crossing over from tv to film. Although Doom is supposed to have an accent. Oh well, not McMahon's fault he was mis-casted.  Still he makes the best of the part.When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and usee their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic!Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies.  So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast. I like it because it has it's own style. Who says a comic movie has to be overly serious like DareDevil the Hulk or the Punisher . This movie has more of a cartoonish style and what is so terrible about that. I think that is what makes it a good adaption to the comic. So what if it's aimed for kids, aren't they the ones who read comics ? Plus the effects are not that bad like Ebert & Roeper said. When Reed stretches around The Thing to calm him down, I think that  looked great and just how it should look.

He was the funniest part of Bruce Almighty, the funniest part of Anchorman, and his show The Office is just plain funny.  This late summer comedy should have been released earlier in the summer, maybe it would have made more money.  Hopefully word of mouth will carry it, because audiences are loving it and critics are too.  The movie is absolutely hilarious.  Carell plays this quiet guy who works at an electronics shop and he gives this guy lots of charm.  This movie actually has character because we get some flashbacks of his past experiences with women and how they fail miserably.  So in a basic sense we do have depth in the character and that allows the audience to connect more.  There are \"scenes\" in this movie like in most comedies because the movie flows very nicely.  For instance in Wedding Crashers there was the \"dinner scene\" or the \"bedroom scene\".  In Anchorman there was the \"news team fight scene\".  This movie really has only one \"scene\" and that would be \"the waxing scene\".  Overall the movie flows and the comedy is layed out within it.  There are some hilarious moments in this one and the ending is probably one of the funniest things I have seen in quite some time.  It's also a nice addition to the \"R\" rated comedy genre.  Previously, only the Farrelly Brothers were able to give us laugh out loud \"R\" rated comedy.  This summer we had the very funny Wedding Crashers and now the even funnier 40-Year Old Virgin.  The character that Carell plays is so simple-minded that it makes it very easy for the audience to connect with.  This movie has enough charm and heart to make it a sappy romance movie, but it also has enough crude sex humor to make it just plain hilarious.ACTING: Steve Carell is a very funny man and he proves that he is more than a supporting actor with this role.  He carries the role with ease and he does not steal the show from the other actors and actresses in the film.  The entire cast in this movie is hilarious and Carell does not have all the funny scenes in the movie, and I'm glad it's like that.BOTTOM LINE: It has character and it has some crude sex humour, it is hilarious.  The end will have you laughing into the credits, and you will be glad you took the time to see it.  I found this to be funnier than Wedding Crashers and an overall better comedy.

The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.

After all, this was the singer my dad used to listen to. Little did I know how fascinating Cash's tale would be.The story touches on Cash's childhood and the tragedy and abuse that would provide the basis for many of his songs. Johnny Cash didn't have the nicest voice but when he sings about pain and regret, you honestly believe he's inside Folsom Prison. Most of the film charts Cash's inevitable path from aspiring songwriter to cultural icon. He has the expected bumps along the way but the tale ends up being inspiring. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon turn in Oscar worthy performances as Cash and his wife and frequent collaborator June Carter Cash. A fun part of the films is that Johnny and June were contemporaries of Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis and we get to see them represented as well.These kinds of movies are good for people of my generation because they bring home exactly how innovative and visionary the performers of the past were. It's easy to hear Johnny Cash's voice over an Alamo commercial or see Ray Charles crooning about Diet Pepsi and think they are just silly old men trying to milk their fame. Movies like this make us reinvestigate their pasts to see exactly how trend setting they were. Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were cool, they were the very essence of cool.

What made Johnny Cash such an icon was that he was an \"everyman\" and Phoenix gives his all to not only capture every subtle nuance but also to make him believable as a flawed human being.  Reese Witherspoon's performance, as well, is surprisingly good. There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde, and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing.

More is rarely truly more.Many of the action sequences reminded me of how someone who lived it would TELL the story, not how it actually happened (exaggeration for effect):Specifically, the idea of Kong Repeatedly falling down cliffs, fighting off T-Rex's, etc. all the while holding an unscathed Ann in one-hand seems a bit absurd. If it happened for only a moment, it might have some punch (like a close call.) But instead is happens for several minutes, yet she is never harmed, no backlash, nothing. Imagine getting into a car crash for 2-3 minutes and escaping unharmed. That's the same physics for these scenes.Another scene features the crew trying to escape a stampede of Brontosaurus', but the scene is so jam-packed with the creatures in such a small space, it looks more cartoon-ish than believable.Another incredulous scene features a young man who the filmmakers go out of their way to tell you has no experience with guns. Later, in the heat of battling giant inspects and larvae, he loads a Tommy gun and shoots giant crickets off his comrade, some 6-10 feet away. Not once does he ever hit his friend. Even in the hands of the most trained marksman this scene is a stretch beyond stretches.When Kong escapes into the streets of New York, all is pure chaos and non-stop madness. But the second he finds Ann (or rather, she finds him), the streets are suddenly dead quiet with no sign of destruction. Huh? I also had a very hard time believing that the crew could effortlessly track Kong on such a vast, incredibly dangerous-terrain island.There are many other scenes that defy logic and physics that really took away from them, when they should have been highlights of the film.As far as the length of the film - there were many scenes and sub-stories that seemed completely unnecessary or were totally unfulfilled. The story between Mr. Hayes and Jimmy escapes me entirely. It was interesting until one of them is killed, the other one cries and then you never see or hear of either again. Yet, we've spent approx. 10-20 minutes focused solely on them and their history. Why? It takes literally an hour to REACH the island. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, we finally reach New York. Don't get me wrong, once the action starts, it's pretty relentless. But you can't tell me in a story as simple as King Kong that there's any reason not to get this film down to closer to 2 hours, instead of breaking the 3-hour mark. I think I would be more forgiving if we were left with any sort of solace or payoff at the end, but it ends rather flatly (no pun intended.) I realize it's a re-make, but if Jackson is going to take liberties to build up characters and make us sit through 3-hours, there better well be a good reason. I never found one.Despite all the above mentioned, there were many aspects I did like. The realism of Kong having true gorilla mannerisms was great and it really lends to the viewer's sympathy for him as a wild animal, simply following trying to his instincts. For that same reason, I found the ending to be gut-wrenching, as well as his captivity scene. The action and visual effects are stunning and once they start, they don't let up. I really felt like I had been somewhere extraordinary when it was over.I thought all of it was very well acted, but unfortunately, there wasn't much of a reason to be. It's all action and the only emotion most people will feel is between Ann and Kong. I felt very little nothing for Ann and Jack's romance, which is too bad.In the end, I would recommend this film as a visual stunner and to true fans of King Kong, or fans of fast-paced action and adventure films (after the first hour, anyway.) If you've never seen the original, or aren't interested in the concept, there should be no problem in skipping it.Lastly, I would NOT recommend it for kids.

After the FANTASTIC Lord Of The Rings movies, I guess I figured Peter Jackson could do no wrong. And make no mistake, his King Kong remake is not a bad movie at all... but it certainly isn't great.Part of the problem is the original. The original's storyline seems too perfect in comparison. Whenever Jackson's film deviated from the original's storyline, I found myself thinking that the remake was a weaker film storywise because of it. And its not just because I like the original, the 1976 Jessica Lang remake deviated from the original, and it actually had some improved moments (although the 1976 version is not a very good movie over all).A major complaint I have with Jackson's film is it is TOO LONG. Not that 3+ hours is too long, but when 40 minutes of the film is absolutely NOTHING but padding, just meaningless FLUFF, what's the point of having it in the movie? Obviously, Jackson was wallowing in his joy at getting to make his King Kong, and all that padding seriously effects the flow of the movie. Had 40 minutes been trimmed, the film would be better.I also must say there is FAR too much emphasis on the effects in this film. There is a particular sequence involving stampeding dinosaurs which was WAY too long, rather stupid, and apparently was included just so Jackson could say 'Look what we can do!'. A very weak and pointless sequence in the movie. In addition, the fight scenes that Kong is involved in are REALLY unrealistic and badly choreographed.A further complaint (although this one is minor), is that Kong's first appearance onscreen has no suspense buildup, no shock value to seeing this HUGE gorilla. The 1976 version did a great job with this, and I guess I expected at least as good a moment from Peter Jackson. Also, the ending wasn't handled all that greatly, athough it was passable. Jack Black's delivery of the famous last line in the movie was TERRIBLE however, and way off base.Well, that's enough complaining, here are some good things about the movie! Kong looks great in the film, although it does take some getting used to. After all, THIS Kong looks like a REAL gorilla, not a man in a monkey suit like all previous Kongs.The acting is generally very good, and the sets look fantastic (the minimalist Skull Island looks exactly like you can imagine it would if it existed in the real world). There are some truly touching moments in this film between Naomi Watts and Kong- hard to believe from a CGI gorilla, but its true. Finally, the story stays quite true to the classic original, which is a good thing.All in all, Peter Jackson's remake is a good film, but I really expected more. With all the time and money spent on this, plus the considerable talents of Jackson and his crew, I expected a movie on the level of Lord Of The Rings. Sadly this was not the case. While I recommend everyone see Jackson's film just because of the enormity of the project, don't view it with expectations of exceeding the original- you will most likely be VERY disappointed (like I was).

There's a protracted sequence when Kong battles three velocoraptor-like beings while trying to keep Naomi Watts alive.  It is breathtaking..in the best way...it makes you hold your breath.  Later, the sequence a top the Empire State Building is damn near perfect.  It feels so cold, lonely and primal up there, and Peter Jackson films everything from angles that quite literally leave you dizzy.  A couple of scenes were still a bit rough, though, to be fair.  The scene in which the explorers all flee from underneath the giant legs of a stampeding brontosauruses doesn't quite convince.  It shows it's green-screen seams.  But overall, this is some of the best stuff ever.  Kong himself is simply great...totally convincing.Jack Black is well cast in a part that isn't as much against type as some would claim.  A driven, unethical ego-maniac.  That's not such a stretch, is it?  Adrien Brody is quite nuanced in his role...which was smaller than I thought it would be, but well done.  Kyle Chandler has a smallish role as the \"star\" of Black's new film, and he's really funny.  But it is Naomi Watts' show...every scene she plays is done with whole-hearted conviction.  Her interactions with Kong make you forget totally that he was NOT in these scenes with her.  It all feels completely authentic...which for such an outrageous story is pretty amazing.  She feels like an \"old-time\" star...all modern mannerisms, all modern irony are gone.Also, the scene on a frozen pond in Central Park is brilliant.  If you have a dry eye during that one (or God-forbid, during the final scene between Watts and Kong) I do feel bad for you.Yes, the film requires an attention-span.  But it rewards with so many riches.  It is not a film for little kids, not because of the action, but probably because of the time it takes getting there.  I saw a lot of restless 8 or 9 year olds in the theater.  But I saw a lot of 13 year olds (including my own) totally enthralled.  And I even caught myself literally on the edge of my seat.  I NEVER do that...I'm far to \"cool\" to get that caught up in a film...but the epic KONG made me feel like a kid at his first movie again.

You can see his expression go from fear it wont be her, to calm, and sad acceptance.  Throughout, Kong looks doomed and aware of it, even on the island.  He seems to be an older creature, and tired of the throne, which makes the protector relation to the girl more convincing.Really, a true classic.

While I didn't mind the extra time devoted to character development in the beginning, judging from many of the other reviews it's obviously too long for some viewers. Director Peter Jackson may be accused by some as the king of bloat, endlessly padding his movies with superfluous action scenes that don't really move the story along and Kong is no exception. The most obvious example for me is the dinosaur stampede scene. Jack Black and crew run under a herd of brachiosaurs while being simultaneously hunted by velociraptors. Well, a little or a lot of belief suspension is needed depending on your point of view and it is action for action's sake. But this is a fantasy movie, an escapist diversion designed to entertain, which it does quite well. This isn't Citizen Kane and it isn't ment to be. It's not meant to conform to reallity. Let's face it, if Kong were real, every time he moved the weight of his body would snap his arms and spine like twigs. But for the most part the action is outstanding, especially Kong's battle with three tyranosaurs and the scenery and sets are wonderful.But where PJ succeeds is not in the over the top choreographed action sequences, but in the emotional resonance he brings to Kong. He was able to make a CGI monkey not only believable, but a powerful character in his own right. He's not just a monster. Kong is portrayed as an embattled warrior/king whose scared body belies his ultimate loneliness. He is the last of his kind and his human-like pathos is amazing and palpable. Andy Serkis the actor who also played Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings was the model for King Kong and it is his facial expressions that were used as the basis for Kong. He really should win some sort of award for \"best digital actor\" or whatever you would call it as it is a new category marvelously pioneered by he, PJ and the effects folks. Kong is ultimately destroyed by his love for Ann Darrow portrayed by Naomi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling. Kong is a tragic and sympathetic figure. The  moment he dies you can see the light go out of his eyes, a remarkable bit of CGI wizardry and it is truly sad. As Jack Black says at the end of the movie with dialog lifted verbatim from the original, \"twas beauty killed the beast.\"As far as the DVD is concerned Peter Jackson and company have once again outdone themselves in the extra features department.

In 1976, the film was remade and many didn't like it. Now, in 2005, director Peter Jackson, the man who brought you the epic Lord of the Rings films, breathes life back into our favorite ape!THE PLOT: If you've seen the original, you already know the story. If not, I'll tell you.A film crew consisting of Carl Denham, the director, Ann Darrow, the beautiful actress, Jack Driscoll, who is the storywriter, and many others. They are making a film on the mysterious Skull Island, an island that's not on the maps. What they find there is crazy natives, reptillian beasts, and a giant ape known as Kong!SFX: The CGI is amazing. The fur, scars, and expressions on Kong are really detailed.LENGTH: About 3 hours and 7 minutes. So if your one of those people who have a short attention span, you might want to see another film. Personally, I think the length adds to all the detail.ACTION: Lots of action. My favorite part is when Kong has to fight all those dinosaurs.EMOTION: Very emotional at the end. I shedded a tear at some scenes.ACTING: Good acting. Naomi Watts was perfect for the role.SHOULD I TAKE MY LITTLE KIDS TO SEE IT?: Well, there are a few parts that are pretty scary and violent, and most kids couldn't sit through a 3 hour film, so no. I reccomend for people ages 12 and up to see it.OVERALL: Even better than the original. One of my favorite movies of the year. Peter Jackson's done it again!EDIT: What's with all the \"no\" votes?

If you didn't care for the original 1933 horror classic, King Kong, it is doubtful you will warm to this mega version.  That being said, this update is a marvelous, big production that entertains and excites without sacrificing any of its emotional substance.  As escapist fare with heart, the new King Kong has blockbuster written all over it, and in this case that's a good thing, a very good thing indeed.It is Depression era in New York City where Carl Denham (Jack Black), a frustrated movie director, gambles that he can make a hit film on a remote island.  Denham happens upon Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), an unemployed actress/comedienne, and casts her as his star.  With some deception, he embarks on his filmic voyage with reluctant screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Arriving at uncharted Skull Island, the film crew ventures inland and is confronted by unfriendly natives who later kidnap Darrow as a human sacrifice.  As Driscoll leads the ship's crew to rescue Ann, a gigantic, fierce gorilla called Kong approaches and seizes her.  Driscoll and the others are in hot pursuit through a prehistoric land where they are attacked by gigantic creatures.  Kong fights his way through carnivorous dinosaurs with his female captive in hand until they reach his mountain top lair.  Kong is a vicious animal, but he also reveals a gentler side when tantalized by Ann's comedic and athletic talents.  The two begin to form an unlikely bond.  When Driscoll manages to rescue Ann, an enraged Kong chases them until Denham tranquilizes the beast.  Now a major attraction on Broadway, Kong is a prisoner until he breaks free to wreak havoc while searching for Ann.  When the two are reunited, it culminates atop the Empire State Building as Kong is attacked by warplanes in a heartrending finale.Does the new Kong justify the hype and expectations?  Yes, it is the complete moviegoing experience.  There are thrills, spectacle, humor, and a sense of heroic adventure, which are rare even in the post-Indiana Jones era.  It would take the superhuman effort of a director like Peter Jackson (and writers Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh), who had just completed the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy, to tackle this project.  This is an old fashioned film that stays closely to the original script.  That Jackson takes his time in quieter moments to develop his characters and never stumbles when the action starts is truly amazing.  Just when you think our heroes are safe, a new danger pops up to keep you at the edge of your seat. He is a master showman of creative, funhouse perils, and when he does things, bigger is better.  He re-imagines legendary sequences from the original and takes them to new heights.  When Kong fights a dinosaur, he battles not two but three dinosaurs in a clash of the titans!  Kong's rampage on Broadway reminds you of the Piccadilly Circus sequence in An American Werewolf in London.  When he is reunited with Ann, the two communicate through unspoken language.  It is a moment of truth that Jackson films with an eerie beauty.  You just know Jackson is a romantic as he sets up his dawn raid at the Empire State Building and gives his biggest star a great sendoff that compares favorably to the original.As for Kong himself, the (CG) computer-generated effects are phenomenal as the broadest of emotions and the tiniest of mannerisms and facial nuances (like blinking his eyes) are eloquently captured.  Imagine that, pathos from a CG creation!Literally a far cry from original star Fay Wray, Naomi Watts gives the best performance in emoting true feelings and playing off her giant ape convincingly.  Adrien Brody displays the necessary heroics in a role that doesn't demand much more.  Jack Black was bold casting, but his character doesn't always work.  Although entertaining, his Denham is more calculating and morally ambiguous than actor Robert Armstrong's 1933 depiction.Technically the film is a marvel, and the art direction and special effects meld seamlessly together so that it is impossible to tell one from the other.  Rarely do the effects look artificial except in the dinosaur stampede.  The stunning visuals and fluid camera work are like eye candy, and many scenes are shot with a fresh perspective or point of view.  Some of the action scenes are almost too much overkill, but Jackson gets away with it because his other scenes are so impressive.At three hours running time, it moves fairly well.  It takes an hour to get to Kong, but when he does appear, the film becomes one big, nonstop chase.  There are brief lulls, but credit Jackson with not rushing to an action scene and instead savoring the quiet moments that establish the most important relationship in the story.  What's satisfying in the relationship between Kong and Ann is that it is one of companionship and love without the overt sexuality of the original.There are a couple of unsettling moments when Denham confronts the natives and a spider pit sequence that could be nightmarish for children.  This pit sequence pays homage to a scene that was cut from the original and expands on the possibilities in nasty ways.  If you thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's insects were creepy, watch out!Jackson wows his audiences with his talent for managing enormous spectacles and imbuing them with humanity.  This film verifies his prowess as one of the most gifted directors of his generation.  Audiences looking for adventure of the highest order will find a lot to enjoy here.

Most of them were great and shouldn't have been removed from the theatrical version whose beginning 45 minutes just dragged on and on. This extended version really improves things for me.  The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.

A movie that both men and their gals will like. Like Titanic, Kong has enough action to keep boys of all ages happy and a romance (complete with tragic ending) to get the ladies crying.And what a romance. Kong and Naomi Watts light up the screen with that most famous of dysfunctional cross species parings. And while you may be mumbling Stockholm Syndrome at the beginning (Not to mention whiplash, jeez Jackson turn down the rag doll physics on the Naomi Watts CGI effect. The way Kong flings her around she should end the film in a body cast) the romance seems to win even the cynics (yours truly) at the end.The rest of the cast is also top notch with Jack Black playing an Orson Wells style director so well it is almost freighting. Speaking of frightening many people wondered aloud how Jackson would handle the racist caricature (by today standards) of the island natives especially considering the whole disturbing white wizard versus the \"dark forces\" subtext of the LOTR films. Not to worry the embarrassing stereotypes of happy dancing black people are mocked in the Kong stage show putting that embarrassing Hollywood episode to rest.Instead the residents of Skull Island are some of the scariest people ever put on film. Pushing the PG-13 rating to the limit they put the can back in cannibal. It's nice to see natives bashing skulls, going into voodoo trances and kidnapping white woman they invoke the much happier stereotype of the true island savage. Hell they are scarier than the ape.Possible racial insensitivity aside Kong is far from perfect. While the special effects are overall top notch there are seams. For example when people run with the dinosaurs the limit of the green screen seems to show through (And could we get a moratorium on velociraptors in movies. They are really getting clich&eacute; and being a relatively new paleontological find really don't fit in a thirties era Kong movie. Yes I know that isn't logical but they kind of seem modern as if a character had a cell phone).The other real problem is length. This feels like the directors cut. With an easy 30 minutes of film that could (and probably should) end up on the cutting room floor.

After winning Oscars for his labour of love, the Lord of the Rings, he got to turn his attention back to making his childhood fantasy, a remake of King Kong.And it shows, in all the little details.The music from the original King Kong was used in the scene on Broadway, when King is revealed to the audience. They actors playing the natives in that scene are wearing the same style costumes that were worn by the \"actual natives\" in the original. A lot of attention was paid to making New York look like it did in the original movie, whenever possible. Many of the scenes are lifted from the original movie. The last line definitely is.At the same time, Jackson is true to his roots. Some of the horrifying scenes and cinematography hearken back to his days making horror movies (such as the first encounter with all of the skulls on the island).I also liked the sly references that occurred from time to time. For instance, the director (played by Jack Black) has to go with Ann Darrow (played by Naomi Watts), because Fay Wray is unavailable, making a movie for RKO (which would have been the original King Kong, if you think about it).So, with all this attention to detail, how could I not love this movie? It's a great popcorn movie, with a great supporting cast (the cast is all supporting Kong, after all). The special effects are fluid and believable, and the music score works well. Andy Serkis deserves special note, for researching out how gorillas move about, and he's captured it well in his portrayal of Kong.It's definitely worth seeing.

Even though this movie is more than three hours long, I found it to be one of the best movies to be released this year.The story takes place in 1933, where Ann Darrow (played by Naomi Watts), a theatre actress, loses her job and is trying her best to make ends meets. Meanwhile Carl Denham (played by Jack Black), a movie director, runs away with the film equipment from the company after they reject his script. Having no actress to play the lead role, he sees Ann and asks her to act in his movie. He also traps Jack Driscoll (played by Adrien Brody), the writer for his film, into coming along with them for the filming. Ann and Jack fall in love along the way. Carl has other plans for his movie, which includes filming in an undiscovered island, not knowing what lies in it. When they go there, they experience things that would change their lives forever.Since I haven't watched any previous versions of King Kong (even though I knew vaguely about the story), I really cannot compare how good or bad it is from the others, but I can say that I loved watching this film! It has everything in it: love, action, adventure, drama etc. which is what one expects from such a movie. The first one hour of a movie is a little slow, because it only shows the character developments; but after they reach Skull Island, the movie becomes a wonderful rollercoaster ride with a lot of twists and turns, amazing special effects, action, drama, everything put into one. Even though this movie is really long, I didn't find it dragging, but I admit that some of the scenes could have been easily omitted.Naomi Watts once again shows us that she is a talented actress by playing her role as Ann Darrow. Some reviews mention that all she did was scream a lot in the movie, but I feel her performance was the best because it is really hard to act with an imaginary character, especially one such as King Kong. Jack Black, Colin Hanks, Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Kyle Chandler and the rest of the cast also acted wonderfully! Even though I like Adrien Brody's acting, I feel his character was a complete waste in this film, as he never really did anything that had a major impact in the storyline. I feel that is one of the few things that Peter Jackson could have revised. But other than that, I loved everything about King Kong.

I haven't paid attention but I hope this did not win any special effects awards.  The effects of this movie and those of its type are not artistry or cinematic skill, it's all a matter of computer technology being powerful enough to process and render it all.This has all the undesirable aspects associated with CGI.  It has the overly elaborate absurd action sequences.  People run under a stampede of dinosaurs always finding the right spot to avoid being trampled and a guy karate kicks a dinosaur as he jumps from the foot of a larger dinosaur.  We have outrageous falls and always something available and utilized to break the action and he used as a swing to further combative action.  Ordinary people are utilizing everything in the environment to do amazing feats.We also have the ridiculous shifting camera angles that seem so unnatural because they can not represent anyone's point of view.This movie is backed by a bland musical score.  The acting is equally bland and doesn't cause any identification to the characters.  To me this movie hinges on the identification of the relationship between Kong and the woman which was created so beautifully in the 1976 version.In this one, Kong is whipping the woman around violently.  So much so that her neck would have to be broken.  Kong also starts out displaying threatening intimidation and intimidating bullying of the woman.  The mood becomes like a kid's movie as the woman wins Kong over by juggling and dancing for his entertainment.I was also annoyed by the movie switching to horror mode with the natives being presented as witch type characters.The bulk of the movie is spent in CGI Jurassic Park mode with constant CGI dinosaur attacks and Kong/Dinosaur battles.  We also have multitudes of large CGI creatures attacking the other group of adventurers.As I should have expected but had hoped against, the CGI goes beyond over the top when giant insects are swarming on a guys head and body as he jumps around erratically.  His buddy then gets a machine gun and blasts off the insect attackers that are grasping him.This really had nothing at common with the groundbreaking film from 1932 besides ending as expected.  Despite recreating nothing worthwhile from the 1932 classic, it did decide to bring back the worst aspect which was the corny ending remark.  \"It was beauty that killed the beast\".It is so frustrating to constantly see such uninspired garbage being rated 4 out of 5 stars here on Amazon and making so much money.

Audrey Tautou who is supposed to be the key is actually useless.  She does basically nothing.  She is supposed to know how everything works but she can't do the puzzles so she needs Tom Hanks, who is supposed to know nothing about all this, to do all of them for her.  Also they talk about how great it would be for a female to take over the church which I agree would be fantastic, but they just assume that the next heir to the thrown is a man.  This movie is a sexist attack on sexism.  But its heart is in the right place I guess.  (*(*(*(*(END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER END OF SPOILER)*)*)*)*)  In all, this movie was pretty good.  It might be a good thing to watch it if you are open minded to other opinions.  Just don't go see it if you hate the idea that is tries to convey.

Let's try to set that right a little. Pirates Of The Caribbean 2, or in short Pirates 2, rocks !!! Like its predecessor did (Pirates 1). The pace is even more fast and furious (pardon my pun). It stars even more exotic, sometimes frightening or repulsive figures, like Davy Jones and Co. and Bootstrap Bill. For pure entertainment value, it is an excellent, smartly put together movie. I watched it in the movie theater together with my 13-year old son. We both enjoyed it tremendously. Everything is done with so much class and care for detail and sense of humour. As it ought to be, if you have a budget of well over $ 200 million to spend. We specifically liked The Flying Dutchman and its crew. OK, so there are a few holes in the script and at certain points the explanation lacks. Not a little, but a lot ! But who cares ? Explaining it all would have necessitated a fourth movie. Not that we would have minded, though. In all Pirates 2 is a delicious, almost 2,5 hour rollercoaster ride, with Johnny Depp who carries the whole movie almost alone (as he did the previous part of the saga). With Captain Jack Sparrow he has created a movie figure that has already become legendary in its own time and will become a classic for the ages for sure. Captain Jack's every line was a feast in itself. We both can't wait for Pirates 3 to come out and hope that the DVD-edition for home viewing will come soon and equipped with lots of savvy extra's.

On one level I agree:  it is even better than the large host of avid reviewers have said.  One has to go all the way back to 1946 and Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to find a grown up fantasy film of such power and beauty.  To call this a masterpiece in reality is to engage in banalities.  It is more than that:  it is the touchstone for all future efforts at grown up fantasy.  I don't want to demean THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but that was at its heart a film more for kids than adults.  I fully endorse showing it to all but the most sensitive young children.  But PAN'S LABYRINTH should be restricted to adults only.The film is set around the time of the allied invasion of Normandy, several years after the victory of the fascists over the leftists in the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl whose mother is traveling to a remote area of Spain where her husband, the brutal military leader Capit&aacute;n Vidal is engaged in his task of suppressing the resistance that has refused to acknowledge the fascist regime in Spain.  He is on every level a wretched man, focused entirely on appearance and on producing a male heir and otherwise oblivious of the needs of Ofelia's mother, who is suffering a difficult pregnancy.Ofelia is a reader of books, many of them fairy or folk tales.  Very early in the film she finds herself entering a fairy tale of her own when she sees a praying mantis that she imagines is a fairy and which turns out to be, in fact, a fairy tale.  The fairy leads her through a nearby maze to an entrance to an underground staircase at the bottom of which she encounters a rather gruesome fawn who informs her that she is in fact the daughter of an underground king and is in fact immortal.  He gives her a book of blank pages that he tells her will show her what tasks she must complete in order to return to her parents and her kingdom.The most interesting thing to me about Ofelia's story is that while one is tempted to read this as an attempt to escape from the hellishness of her life under Capit&aacute;n Vidal, nowhere is there a hint that her adventures occur merely in her head.  The closest one comes to anything like this is the very end, where Capit&aacute;n Vidal sees Ofelia, whom we have seen talking to the fawn.  While we can see the fawn, Vidal cannot.  But it is surely not a stretch to imagine that she could see it while he could not, especially given the fact that she was able to enter the entrance to the stairway via a route not accessible to Vidal.  In other words, we are not supposed to be reading her descendence to her previous home as metaphorically escapist, even if it literally is so.This is a gruesome film.  It is an interesting combination of horribly realistic events combined with nightmarish fantasy scenes.  Vidal is far more monstrous than any of the fantasy creatures Ofelia encounters.  He has a tendency towards violence and cruelty.  He shoots people with only the slightest provocation and does not hesitate to torture suspects with his bare hands.  The tasks that Ofelia are asked to complete are hardly more terrible than what she has to endure living under Vidal's roof.  Despite all the horrors, however, despite all the tragic events in the film, the movie has a wonderfully happy ending that does not feel tacked on.  Rather, it feels like just compensation for all the wretched events in the film.The cast is wonderful though with one exception I do not think I've seen any of the performers in any previous film.  Ivana Baquero is extraordinary as Ofelia.  She has a magnificent presence throughout the film and recalls some of the finest child actresses of the past few decades, including Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Anna Paquin.  Sergi L&oacute;pez is oppressively dominating as Vidal.  He easily goes down as one of the most evil characters I've ever witnessed on film and his final moment, in which the worst vengeance is brought upon him, seems completely just.  Maribel Verd&uacute; plays Mercedes, the head housekeeper who befriends Ofelia and who is an informant to the resistence in the mountains.  I mentioned above that I had seen only one performer before.  That is Doug Jones, who has carved an interesting niche in film.  Initially a professional mime, Jones gradually has taken a number of fascinating roles requiring unusual degrees of physical expression.  I first became aware of him in the famous Emmy-nominated episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER entitled \"Hush, where he played one of the Gentlemen.  But Jones will be familiar to most film fans from his role of Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's film HELLBOY, a role he is reprising for HELLBOY 2.  In PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones plays two roles, the fawn and the pale monster whose eyes are in his hands.  Both characters are unforgettable (much like the Gentlemen in BUFFY), once seen never to be forgotten.A couple of reviewers have stated that this film is \"boring.\"  I have absolutely no idea what they were talking about or what their film going background is.

How could a film with great-looking villains, amazing special effects, and Peter turning to the dark side, be bad? Well, for one thing, as great as the villains and special effects looked, they lacked heart and soul. As for Peter becoming more hostile and evil, the filmmakers decided to make a joke out of it and the whole storyline lost its punch. Also, by adding more, useless Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson/Harry Osborn drama, the story became bloated, routine, and at times, boring. \"Spider-Man 3\" was the weakest of the trilogy.After finally watching the film for a second time, I found the film slightly more tolerable(mainly because I knew what I was in for). It still contained the same problems though. First, the storyline is filled with too many stories that are connected in totally unbelievable ways. Second, even though the audience has been close with the characters the last two films, Peter Parker, M.J. Watson, and others seem very one-dimensional here. Finally, when the film should have been serious, it opted for a more funny tone (which, ironically, I found not funny at all). Even though I have my complaints about the film, there are many parts that I did enjoy, mainly the special effects and fight scenes, James Franco's and Thomas Haden Church's performances, and in my opinion, the greatest scene of the trilogy, the creation of Sandman. These aspects elevate the film from being a waste of time.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is loving life. He has the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), he's doing well in school, and most importantly, his alter-ego, Spider-Man is finally being revered for all his hard work. Regardless of all the good things happening to him, there is still a lot he needs to deal with.First, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), knows he is Spider-Man and still places the death of his father in the web-slinger's hands. Harry eventually dons a new version of the Goblin suit, hoping to get revenge.Second, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual killer of Peter's loving uncle, escapes prison and ends up falling into a science experiment that turns him into the Sandman.Third, M.J. begins to move away from Peter to Harry. After her show does poorly and she's fired from the role, she begins to dislike Peter because of the success he is receiving as Spider-Man. When M.J. turns to Harry, Harry decides to use to his advantage to make Peter miserable.Four, an alien symbiote lands on Earth and similar to a parasite, uses Peter's suit as a host. When he dons his new black suit, he becomes more powerful, but at the same time, more aggressive and volatile. Once he finally gets rid of the symbiote, it finds a new host: Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes supervillain, Venom.Five...Six...Seven...Eight...The script is a mess. Besides what I mentioned above, there are many other stories in the film that deal with both Peter and Spider-Man. The main issue I have with the script is that it consists of coincidences. It's a coincidence that Spider-Man is fighting the villain, Sandman, who also happened to kill Peter Parker's uncle. It's a coincidence that the alien symbiote from space landed ten feet away from Peter instead of somewhere else on the planet. It's a coincidence that when Spider-Man rips himself free of the symbiote, his rival at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock, is right below him in some random church and then becomes Venom. Once he's Venom, it's a coincidence he knows that M.J. is Peter's love interest even though he's never seen her or the two together before. \"Spider-Man 3\" is ridded with all these situations that are unbelievable in terms of story and make the film much longer than needed.Maybe I'm being a tad harsh. After all, the film is based off a comic book. Yet, this doesn't excuse the poorly written characters. The audience has already learned and cared a lot about Peter Parker and M.J, but the third film does nothing new with them. Even though they are together, they are still having tough times to work things out, which I find quite annoying. At the end of \"Spider-Man 2,\" M.J. knew what she was getting into by being with Peter and how he wouldn't always be around for her physically. In this film, she pouts and whines, because Peter is never there for her, making the ending to the great \"Spider-Man 2\" look pointless. I wished that in this chapter they would have just been a happy couple and had M.J. more in the background of the story.In a superhero film, the villains are usually the most interesting and the fun part of the film is when our hero fights them. The problem with \"Spider-Man 3\" is that the villains are similar to their characters on a comic book page: flat. As cool as both of the main villains are, they lack any depth or real characterization. All the audience knows about Sandman is that he killed Uncle Ben and now he searches for money to help his daughter get better from some sickness. That's it. The most hurtful part of the film is that the coolest villain in the Spider-man universe, Venom, gets reduced to fifteen minutes of screen time. What's even worse is that he doesn't have a long tongue or a muscular body frame like the comics, but instead looks like black Spider-Man with a mouth like a raptor and a face that changes from the raptor mouth to Eric Foreman's face...I mean, Eddie Brock's face. Venom is just there. There's no real purpose for him to be in the story. If I had had my way, I would have let the ending of this one be Brock changing into Venom. That way, Sandman would have more time to develop as a character and then Venom could have his own film with Spider-Man. By throwing too many villains into the pot, the film suffers.My final problem with the film is the humor placed throughout. In the first two \"Spider-Man\" films, I laughed with the film when intentional, but in \"Spider-Man 3,\" I found myself laughing at what was happening on screen. Peter's transformation to the dark side is what I'm referring to. What should have been a serious moment in the film becomes incredibly stupid. For instance, when he walks down the street, he breaks out into dance and \"Saturday Night Fever\" type moves. It's really embarrassing. As I watched that scene, I cringed, wanting it to be over as fast as I could, but it goes on for a good five minutes unfortunately. Other \"funny\" moments throughout take the viewer out of the film, especially at the moments when the viewer is supposed to be most engaged in what's going on.Now, I can finally get on to what I did like about the film. First, the special effects are dazzling. If anything has improved throughout all the films, it's the effects. Sure, Spider-Man is still a computer's creation when slinging around New York, but he felt much more believable this time around. Second, the action scenes are well-done and plentiful. None are overlong (even though, Venom's should have been), but they are well shot and edited, especially the Sandman and Spider-Man fight in the underground. Third, the performances by James Franco and Thomas Haden Church are top-notch. While the film suffers from bad writing, these two are the only actors that truly make the most of it. Franco brings a much-needed warmth and charm to the film and his character stands out the most. Even though Sandman isn't a well-developed character, Church really makes the most out of it, which brings me to the best part of the film: the creation of Sandman.Watching grains of sand slowly come together to form Flint Marko is a spectacle. Even though it's totally unrealistic, the special effects team along with the help of Thomas Haden Church, make the scene believable. As Marko tries to form, he stumbles and chunks of sand fall away. Once he realizes what he's becomes, his face of sand changes expressions and with the aid of Christopher Young's score, the scene is just beautiful and breath-taking. It's my favorite scene in the entire trilogy. If the film had more scenes that had great special effects balanced with heart, then it would have been amazing.Overall, \"Spider-Man 3\" is the weakest of the trilogy. It was the one I was looking forward to the most, but was let down due to the script, characters, and the humor. Thankfully, the special effects, action, a few performances, and the creation of a villain were able to make it a better film and redeem it from being a waste of celluloid.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the plot of the movie ?", "id": "8e22f7bd00050d5a97e69103d76dd7a1", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JPGO", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Aside from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou's brilliant acting choices, duly rewarded with Oscar nominations, Blood Diamond offers action, adventure, drama, and a political message that is hard to ignore.Director Edward Zwick gives his film a clean, produced look without taking away the realism and humanistic punch the story delivers.Jennifer Connelly's character leaves something to be desired, but she's still a superb actress and offers a good deal to the story, although her storyline feels a bit contrived towards the end.The story is too intense and multifaceted for me to attempt to describe it.

I reacted in such a way that a 9-year old would react in that it floored me. It was an intense trip and it was a movie that I couldn't forget. Actually it was Hans Zimmer's score I couldn't forget, and Zimmer's score for that movie is what inspired me to become a filmmaker. I own every single film Michael Bay has done and after every movie he does I usually read the onslaught of hatred directed at his movies. Critics hate Michael Bay for one reason and that is because he is one dimensional. Is that so bad though? The man can do action and will always do action. From an action movie perspective he does pretty entertaining work. Armageddon is probably his weakest movie in the small handful of flicks that he has done. He tried to be epic in Pearl Harbor but he leaned too much on action. The result was a long wannabe war film. The Bad Boys films are pure adrenaline fun in the tradition of Lethal Weapon with The Island being his first film that had a message. The Rock is just a simply amazing action film with strong characters. With Transformers we get Bay's biggest piece of eye candy yet.To be honest, when I first heard of this movie I immediately dismissed it. When Bay was named the director I thought what could he do with a movie about toys? I never liked Transformers; I wasn't into that when I was a kid. Luckily Michael Bay made this movie for fans and non-fans. The story revolves around Sam Witwicky; an awkward teenager who gets his first car. Little does he know that his first car is actually an Autobot sent to Earth to retrieve a possession of his. His great grandfather was an explorer who discovered Megatron frozen in the Arctic Circle. Megatron is the leader of the Decepticons who are at war with the Autobots. Both sides are after a talisman called the Allspark which grants unlimited power to the one who possesses it. The Allspark landed on Earth so now the war continues.The first third of the film basically sets up our characters, and we get Michael Bay's trademark way of starting things off lightly. The first scene is usually an indication of the main conflict of the film and then we jump to our characters that are unaware of the situation. Trust me; all his movies usually start that way. What follows is 2.5 hours of trademark Michael Bay. Things go boom, places get destroyed and people run all the while being shot with 9 different cameras running at high frame rates. There are two kinds of Michael Bay movies, and those are non-CGI heavy action movies and CGI heavy action movies. Transformers is the latter and here we see some of the most impressive visual effects ever seen in an action movie. The amount of detail that was put into the robots is amazing. You truly feel their weight and presence in the environment. Their interaction with the environment around them is what makes them so believable. Something that George Lucas didn't do in his newest Star Wars films which led everything to look cartoonish and awkward. The film brings CGI into the real world and not the other way around, so there is limited use of green-screen. The action is shot in pure Michael Bay style. There will be some scenes in slow motion that have human characters running away with the massive robots battling in the background. Those scenes impressively show off the CG work. Another Bay trademark is the \"low-angle swoosh\" in where the camera is placed low and does usually circles or passes by a character. Then you have the score.Steve Jablonsky had been a long time collaborator with Hans Zimmer. Every single Michael Bay movie has been scored by one of Zimmer's collaborators or Zimmer himself. Bad Boys was done by Mark Mancina, Bad Boys 2 was Trevor Rabin, Armageddon was Trevor Rabin also, The Rock was by Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith with some help from Harry Gregson-Williams, Pearl Harbor was Hans Zimmer, and he found Steve Jablonsky with The Island. Jablonksy had never done a high profile movie by himself, but Hans Zimmer stood as score producer and Jablonsky delivered an amazing electronic/synth based score. Jablonsky was my main reason for wanting to see Transformers and again he delivers a high profile action movie score that would make Hans Zimmer proud. He borrows heavily from Zimmer's Batman Begins, in that the score is not that complex. It does its job and makes the action so much more intense and awe inspiring.We get a great performance from Shia LaBeouf who carries the film easily. After this and Indiana Jones 4 coming up it will only be a matter of time until we start seeing him in serious dramatic roles. There is a bright future for this rising star. The voice acting for the Transformers was done to be as close to the original movie as possible. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime. When casting for Megatron Michael Bay decided the original voice actor's voice aged too much so he was replaced by Hugo Weaving from The Matrix Trilogy. We get supporting performances from Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and Anthony Anderson.Transformers is great summer fare. Michael Bay will never win an Academy Award but he is the best at what he does, which is directing action. The only problem with the film is that at times it falls into melodrama, and melodrama with robots can make your eyes roll. It also becomes a big commercial for GM since it profiles about every brand of car they produce. Other than that the film will entertain immensely and you will not feel like you wasted money on another summer dud.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the character?", "id": "5224e1575bc36282137881d277b7607e", "answers": [{"text": "he is one dimensional", "answer_start": 526}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JPO1", "paragraphs": [{"context": "To start off, this film is enjoyable to the die-hard Indy fan - someone like me who grew up watching the daredevil archaeologist in the theaters some 27 years ago.  To be honest, I was so excited to see Indiana Jones in the theaters again after all these years, that I was willing to forgive this film its short comings.  I saw it three times, and each time I found something new I liked, and something new I didn't like.First, while I was hesitant (Warning! Spoilers ahead!) about the concept of Indy having a son, I ended up really liking Shia LeBeouf's portrayal of Mutt Williams.  He has flawless timing and a razor sharp wit that fit perfectly into the film and made him, in my opinion, a likable addition to the franchise.  Karen Allen was great in her reprisal of Marion.  This time she returns with more wisdom and less shock to the chaos around her.  I also like the fact that the story \"came full circle\" for the Jones-Ravenwood love affair.Now for the downside.... The film is choppy.  You are being given a lot of information in random quick scenes that never really allow you to get comfortable in any of them.  You don't have any scenes like you do with Indy and Marcus in Raiders just sitting in Indy's house speaking in reverent tones about great artifacts - although, you do get to see Indy's house, but its quick and you don't feel like you've been offered a seat this time.  Its more just a plot device so he can tell you that his father and Marcus are now both deceased.  You also don't have those little moments where the film is still long enough to hear John William's score and to get that \"epic\" feeling.The computer effects took away from the film.  I can support the use of CGI when it is used to fill in the gaps in a film, like Lord of the Rings.  They couldn't cast a cave troll now could they?  But in the case with Indiana Jones, I would have preferred if they could have stuck with their older film making techniques.  After all, Indiana Jones is happening in a bygone era, and the old serial style techniques and actual sets added to the feel of the old films.  They are sadly missed here.  I wouldn't have minded so much, but the CGI isn't even good.  In the new trend of ILM, their effects are \"too video game\" looking.  It detracts from the flow of the film.There is also the problem of the comedy...In the last three films, Indy was actually a fairly serious person.  However, when placed in the horrible situations he often found himself in, a natural humor emanated that captured audience's hearts.  You found yourself thinking \"boy, I wonder if I could smirk like that in that situation.\"  In this film though, its like the characters were trying to be intentionally funny.  What happened were a lot of re-used phrases from the old films, and facial expressions that were just corny.  Don't do that.  Don't reuse old lines that were once original.  When you say them again, you are just setting up for a bad poorly thought out sequel.The alien concept, in my opinion, did not detract from the film.  I like sci-fi, and I already had a basic notion about the stories surrounded the crystal skulls.  I don't feel that the film did a very good job explaining it though.  Like I said, it was rough and choppy in its editing.  You feel like you are being taken from one scene to the next as quickly as possible.  I loved Spielberg's aliens in Close Encounters, but I was rather disappointed with unveiling of the alien in this film.  I would have been far more impressed if the alien's from Close Encounters had re-appeared here!All in all, you have to take this movie for what it is.  If you are an Indy fan, then the nostalgia wrapped around the film will be more than enough to get you through the film, and you can even enjoy it.  It just will not be the same enjoyment, wonder, and awe that you had with the first three.  I will add this film to my collection for that very reason.  The film had some major problems, but it was fun to sit in the theater again, and hear that theme song start playing while eating popcorn.  That was always the purpose of these films, after all - to entertain.  And, it is Indiana Jones, so all things said, I was happy to be there with him looking for those skulls, and in the end that was what it was all about.  Don't overestimate the quality, but don't underestimate the legend.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the plot good?", "id": "4473f550d53b19b8cd7ed02302e7906a", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Oh boy, oh boy. It's finally time to put into words anything regarding the fourth Indiana Jones film!  Whoa, what a low rating!  Let me read on and find out why this could be.....hmmmmmm......Okay, I'm back and boned up on what everyone's beef with this film is, and.....and....well, I still don't get why everyone hates on this film so much.  Here's what I'll do folks, I'll state all the most comman complaints regarding this film, and then when I'm done proving why they're all wrong, shortsighted, nit-picky, and stupid, I'll list the ACTUAL problems with this movie and how the ACTUAL flaws don't make it a bad movie.  Okay?Number one, and oh boy is it a big one, WHY ARE ALIENS IN INDIANA JONES?  ALIENS CANT BE/DON'T BELONG IN AN INDY MOVIE!  This baffles my mind to no end.  Why the hell not?  I've heard because Indy movies are about religeous artifacts.  Well, the crystal skulls and some wild theories now and then about where they're from are religeous.  Sure, they're no Judeo-Christian myths, but neither were the stones in the second Indy film.  In the words of the much wiser than you, apparently, Indiana Jones, \"It depends on who your God is\", as he is referring to his son's disbelief in a mishapen skull.  On top of that there are crystal skulls in real life, they are mentioned in this film, and they are linked to the specific skull that plays the maguffin in this film.  Plus, Myans had God myths about them as well.  Now I went to a basic public school and a more basic college, but I knew the implications of the extra terrestrial and the crystal skulls from my studies.  Did no one else honestly know anything about that connection?  Also, the film is set in the 50's!  HELLO!  All the Indy films are modern retellings of old pulpy serials from the 20's, 30's and 40's.  They all reflect that, and what was the biggest genre of films in the 50's?  Alien invasion stories and sci-fi in general.  It's all in the title and in the synopsis.  Why someone can buy the power of god melting Nazi's, magical stones that grow crops and help cult leaders enslave people, and cups of Christ that grant everlasting life---and are guarded by an ancient and very much alive Knight of King Arthur's court, but not aliens blows my friggin' mind.  Really does.Secondly, the oft-quoted by those without a clever bone in their body, \"Nuke the Fridge\" scene.  True, it's silly, impossible and totally rediculous.  You know what else is silly, impossible, and totally rediculous?  Out-running a giant boulder(how'd they get it up there) on foot through a cave, hiding on the outside of a submarine while at sea, fall off of, being dragged under, and climbing under a moving vehicle while being chased and shot at.  Oh, Also, it's very silly to jump out of a plane on a rubber boat and simply land on a slope, survive, and continue down into a river.  It's also unlike to out run, on foot, a massive body of water tumbling towards you.  And I'm pretty sure you can't jump a mine cart 30 feet from one track to another without derailing or dying.  Oh, and lets not forget that Venice doesn't have sewers.  FIRE DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  You can't outrun a plane, that's on fire, that is crashing and burning next to you while you're driving in a tunnel.  Oh, and you can't take out a tank by yourself on horseback.  Phew.....where did all those sill examples come from?  OH YEA, they came from the previous three Indy films!!!!  Spielberg and Lucas wanted these films to be outrageous, so they could reflect the adventures they grew up watching.  Yes, you can't survive a nuclear blast hiding in a fridge, BUT SO WHAT?!?!?!?!  It's Indiana Jones for cryng out loud.  That's the point.  It's fun.  The filmmakers were obviously having fun and up until the fourth movie most nit-pickers,apparently, were having fun too.  Apply this paragraph to the also oft-bitched about three waterfall sequence.Shia Lebeouf.  I don't get it.  He's not horrible.  He's got a natural screen presence and apparently Spielberg really likes him.  Does his looks resemble Harrison Ford or Karen Allen?  Hell to the no!  He looked like a sufficient enough greaser punk with smarts hidden under his visage.  I got it.  It played.  It was okay.  I don't know if some other young actor would've done better.  I do know what we got played well enough.Fourth, the vine swinging with the monkeys.  Yup, pretty silly and convenient for a plot point, but I saw it coming.  I mean, this whole sereis is a love letter to Matinee serials, and Tarzan was a BIG part of that, and they mention that they are going to an Amazon Jungle....nobody really saw this type of thing coming?  I know the average veg viewer doesn't know or really care much about film history, but this was a common thing to happen in jungle serials.  It looks silly,and it is, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a huge smile on my face when the scene appeared.  I'd be more concerned with how Shia managed to reach a moving vehicle while only swinging on vines.  That's impressive.THE GOPHER!!!!! The damn gopher!!!!!!  Really?  There's more than a small minority of people who actually care about this?  Do you guys get out much, I mean, when you're not constantly talking about something that you supposedly hate?  At the opening of every Indy film the Paramount log fades into something live on screen(a mountain Raiders, a gong in Temple of Doom, a cliff in Last Crusade).  This was a funny way to do this and make a self reference.  I thought it was clever and set up the scene for where the first bits of action take place.  It was fine.  Who cares?  You really do?  Oh well......TOO MUCH CGI!!!!  Here's what I think message boards would've looked like back in 1981, if the internet existed, after Raiders of the Lost Ark came out; TOO MUCH MATTE PAINTINGS!  WAY TOO MUCH SPLIT SCREEN BLENDING OF MODELS AND LIVE ACTION.  OH GOD, WAY TOO MANY RUBBER BODIES BLEEDING AND EXPLODING!  UGH, THOSE LIGHTENING FLASHES ARE SO OBVIOUSLY ANIMATED AFTER THE FACT!  Doesn't look real!!!!!  Yeah, CGI is a modern too.  This film didn't overuse it, and it certainly didn't employ it more than the original films employed the special effects tricks they needed to make their story work.  Whether or not the CGI was good or bad is another debate.  Some was great(love the saucer rising at the end), and other times it looked like what it was(some of the jungle action).  You could say the same about the effects in the original.  If Spielberg had access to CGI effects back in the 80's he would've employed them.  It's that simple.  Modern times, modern techniques.  Again, sounding like a broken record, WHO CARE, HONESTLY?Finally, we get to the dreaded quick sand.  Okay, yeah, it was silly.  I was under the impression that it was suppoed to be silly.  I swear that was the idea.  So, you're mad at the film for doing what it set out to do?  Ooookay.  It's no more silly of a comic relief or contrivance then smart monkeys that are smart enough to posion your dates but no smart enough to avoid eating them.  No more silly than spike traps, that are overly elaborate, in an underground cavern being accidentally activated, or an old-timer libraryian mistaking his stamps smack for a pole being smashed into the library floor.  You see?  Your nit-picks can be done to the whole series!!!!!Well, that's the best I can see as far as an overview of what the most common complaints are.  Now, lets get into what is ACTUALLY wrong with this film.  Okay, the Marion subplot was rushed and never fully developed in a meaningful  way. They did a much better job with the son plot.  The two characters argue and then the action moves in.  They never share a legitimate moment.  This is the only subplot in ANY Indy movie where one would HAVE to have seen the first film to enjoy or get a lot out of.  The powers and connection of the crystal skull to the real life Hedges skull.  This is done through loborious dialogue.  Indy films are lite on dialogue.  This one is not.  There's too many scenes of characters explaining the rules or the powers.  Indy being blacklisted doesn't go anywhere.  It's set up but it doesn't pay off.  It is just dropped.  John Williams score is very MEH.  In the three previous films he creates a theme for each film to go with the original Indy theme.  I'll be damned, but I can't find one in this film.  The best parts of the music are taken from Crusade or Raiders.  Kind of a bummer and a lazy effort on his part.  The double agent subplot is too shoehorned.  It's not subtle or truly surprising but kind of eye rolling.  If we had time to get to know the character played by Ray Winstone, Mac, better than maybe there could've been some genuine surprise or tragedy to it, but NOPE. When the aliens finally appear in the flesh the look really derivative.  They're your basic gray guys made famous on The X-Files.  Finally, the ending, and the main villain's demise is a little too similar to what happens at the end of Raiders. That's really about it for the film's REAL faults.This is a pretty good  action/fantasy film.  I love the whole 50's style sci-fi bent.  I'm glad the ship stayed in true 50's fashion and was a saucer.  The sets, as usual with an Indy film, are beautiful to behold.  I love this stuff, dark caverns, old crypts, booby-traps, etc.  Harrison Ford manages to look comfortable in action despite his 66 years of age, and wears the Indy persona like an old, but beloved glove.  His relationship with his son is fun.  He has one great scene with Marion right before he climbs the top of a truck to stop a convoy.  The action scenes are wild and funny just like the other Indy films.  I love the Amazon truck chase that leads to a fist fight amongst giant killer ants.  Spielberg had to revert to his old 80's style of filmmaking for this(nowadays he seems to prefer more washed out colors and grain) and the movie is awesomely photographed and fits in stylistically with the previous entries.  The plots and artifacts for the Indiana Jones franchise are always moot.  They're like James Bond films.  They're excuse for special effects, action, and exotic locations, real and unreal.  All the Indy films basically have the same plot one way or another.  I love this flick and it was great to see Indy again, and would love to see him once more.  If you're 'jonesing' too, check out the Mystery of the Blues episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(or as it is now called The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones).  Harriso Ford plays Indy in 1950 for an opening and ending bookend to this episode.  It's really a good ep plus a nice bonus to see Ford as a bearded Indy.Lighten up and enjoy people.  Obviously, you took these films more serious the the filmmakers intended.  I guess maybe most of you saw these films when you were really young and put too much emphasis on the maguffins or thought they were deep.  I assure you Spielberg and Lucas didn't.  Hell, Spielberg hated the Holy Grail idea, hence why he added the finding his father plot to that film.  He made Last Crusade about that and barely paused over some silly cup-o-Christ.  Maybe you should do the same.  The titles of every film in this series should make you smile at their blunt and silly nature.  Just say them out loud.  See, smiling.  If you're still a child at heart, and you are still in touch with the REAL reason these films are beloved enjoy Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls.PS: Almost forgot about my favorite aspect of Crystal Skull bashing!!!!  The famous 'raped Indy' episode of South Park.  It amazes me that nerdy fanboys didn't get this one.  South Park was making fun of YOU!!!!  Not the movie.  It was making fun of the fact that there was such an over reaction to this film.  That was the joke of 'raped Indy'.  Did you not get that?

It delivered the goods for everyone waiting to check back in with the rough-and-tumble Dr. Henry Jones, (junior ... ahem). But having grown up with Indiana Jones, I've already gotten past the Lucas Factor of being let down long ago. I hung my head in shame after I scurried home from the theatre after seeing 'The Temple of Doom' back in 1984. I wish I had missed that film altogether, even to this day. Needless to say there is a section of this film which I find down-right embarrassing and the Cthulu call for George Lucas.Crystal Skull takes a nose dive during the 'Jungle Chase' scene which seems to be action filler so Cate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf can rack up some screen-time minutes or perhaps fill a quota or a  contractual agreement with the producers. Whatever it was, it was not just the slowest part of the movie but also the most unnecessary and the biggest reminder, or throw back to The Temple of Doom, thus far. Going over cliffs was well covered in parts two and three, but now we have to revisit it again just so we can add to the run time.I do realize that it was just framework to the very interesting fight-action sequence with the ants which was cool and had a nostalgic feel to it. I think that kind of action is what people tuned in for, but what came before it in the ten minutes previous and the next ten minutes after, should have been left in the editing hard-drives.The 'Jungle Chase' scene though, more directly is classic Lucas faire. He's probably covered this same ground in almost every film he's ever done. A lot of people have complained loudly about just this sort of thing spoiling the Star Wars franchise. So why bother to do it again? The scene of a young fighter precariously hanging on to some shaky edifice, fighting for his life with legs splayed akimbo, desperately trying to fend off his enemy and move the story forward with some type of sword fight. Sigh ... please.How many times did we see this stuff in Episode I, II and II? Too many. It only seemed that Lucas began to learn his lessons by the third film, which was already too late as he had alienated his core audience and even most adults. His interest in his Lego Land contracts and peddling to toddlers always looked to interfere with his real filmmaking, unlike Spielberg who never pandered or bowed full-bend to the marketing aspect of these productions never forgetting that the reason for the film was not the toys.So why Spielberg would let this kind of element creep in and slow down such a good movie is beyond me. Maybe he just can't tell the guy, his good friend, George -- that what he's 'seeing' isn't that great after all. We saw this same element in Jedi, which killed the movie and now he pulls it out once more. At least you can see that Spielberg learned a few things over the years with some of his other movies, by using the absurd to insert his heroes into history like inForrest Gumpin the 'Doom Town' sequence.In all honestly, this film is a perfect candidate for fanedit dot com. A place where film editors, some professional, some work-man, anonymously re-edit films removing certain scenes or offending elements, tightening them up and making them better movies in most cases. A good example of work done through fan edit wasBlade III(retitled 'Kill The King'). All instance of Hannibal King, aka Ryan Reynolds is completely removed. Having seen the movie, I can tell you without doubt it's leagues better than the studio release.I thought I had seen everything in film, but watching Dr. Jones step into the refrigidaire and close the door on himself in order to avoid a nuclear blast was pretty riveting to say the least and very inventive. It's exactly this kind of chess-playing in the writing that most people are hoping to see. The scene where Indy crests over the berm and is face to face with the mushroom cloud is a great piece of film-making. For the last two years I've been seeing artificial CG renderings of atomic and nuclear bomb blasts showing up on blogs and littering youtube, now I know why and where they came from. Some people were put-off by this and cried foul, but every element in this franchise is over the top. Trying to ground it in Christopher Nolan workman-style realism is foolish. Are you paying attention?Upping the ante at this point in the film was pretty genius as well as wiley, making room for excellent long-range planning. Immediately after the radioactive scrub down, we learn that Dr. Jones, is ... gasp ... an Army General ... and then a member of OSS ... gasp! ... and later a double-agent within the CIA. The back story that was built up lends this whole franchise to now be reinvented and the older adventures of theYoung Indiana Jonesto be forgotten and revisited, probably picked up as Dr. Jones runs through a secret trap door from Hitler's Bunker with a smoking gun, not played by Shia LeBeuf, but possibly some as of yet unknown. The writers scored a big plus here and I'm sure Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were very happy when they read that portion of the script.The ending of the film where the mantle doesn't pass, yet, is probably the question both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have been batting around themselves. Who will take over my life's work, when my hair is too gray, too thin, my time too short and my interest in the job too waning? You have to wonder who exactly has been groomed to carry on all those unfinished projects, the war adventures of Indiana Jones being apart of that probably massive pile.The Fifth and likely conclusion to this franchise in this era is already being discussed, planned and will probably be announced sometime in March of 2009. Harrison Ford is close to 70 now so time is of the essence in every aspect. The directors are older, too as are the producers. The question of handing his whip & pistol over is a tricky one. Edging out the hero from a franchise has proven fatal before. Yes, back to Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer we go.There was a time in Hollywood when studios no longer wanted to bankroll and produce comic book action movies because a long string of failures that had almost bankrupted several studios in the mid-nineties. A few actually folded. Then along came Wesley Snipes andBlade. It's no secret that Blade reinvigorated the genre and thus the current generation, singularly, owes him a debt of gratitude greater than his IRS burden or the value of Ed McMahon's home. Blade made a lot of money and gave both the confidence and greenlight to other movies that in turn did well and made money.But one day, David Goyer disagreed with Wesley Snipes like a bad episode of House MD and broadcast it unfairly from the rooftops, thus Alienating our favorite Vampire Killer. Wesley didn't think Vampire Hunters teaming up with him was a good idea or that the Vampire Hunters should be teenagers. It sounded good, because after all Vampire films started off with stuff likeCaptain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, again -- it sounded good. But, Wesley openly disagreed with the direction of the franchise and was ignored. It didn't go well, neither did the movie. But I mentioned this already, didn't I? In this scenario, with Harrison Ford, there is no disagreement, but the problem is the same. The studio needs to extricate its hero and find a way to continue without being a clich&eacute;. All I can say is: Good luck, folks.Overall, this story covers a lot of ground, and perhaps in retrospect, maybe too much. Maybe the flaw of this film was giving the audience too much to chew on. I was happy to see Cate Blanchett in something other than a period costume drama of either Elizabeth or a depression era redressing of Katherine Hepburn. I felt the film time that she was given was adequate (minus the 'Jungle Chase') and  her character was more than fleshed out for the escapist action drama that we were all sinking into. Sometimes not overstating a character gives the character more power. Look at Julianne More asMaude Lebowskiwho has little screen time compared to Walter or The Dude, but she has one of the most memorable modern film roles in recent history. Who doesn't remember the line: 'Do you like coitus, Jefferey?'You don't need to beat a viewer over the head in order to make a point. I think we all got the evil persona that she was after the Area 51 scene. Doctor-Professor was a nice touch. Look for it soon in the next Pixar flick. Blanchett's period costume though left much to be desired as she looked more like Lara's work-camp daughter fromDoctor Zhivagothan she ever did as a female version of Dr. Evil in her gray and unappealing jumpsuit. Trying to work us on a seductive Madame Blavatsky angle was good and quite interesting and probably factual to period maniacs of the time, but they overplayed her hand and dashed the project into the rocks that they thought were heading for, all in the drama.Also, as much as I like Ray Winstone, (Sexy Beastis a masterpiece), I felt that his addition was overwrought and unnecessary. Somehow his whole presence seemed very last-minute, maybe his role had something to do with the script leak. Maybe. Maybe not.The ending is quite good. The whole story arc of Roswell, Area 51, General Jones comes together nicely and is probably one of the few times in blockbuster cinema where the subject matter is dealt with in an interesting manner and not treated as an off-handed joke. Knight's 'Signs' was an interesting mix of fundamental religion versus new-age lore and was treated well there. It was handled with equal skill here.Maybe, with a few more viewings and a couple of sit-downs with the commentary track (ahem ... next DVD version of course, as this one doesn't have one), my thoughts will develop and change, but until then, I think I've gilded the Lilly to the point of wilting..... ....", "qas": [{"question": "Where is the flaw?", "id": "9c872afb683ac040881df205379069b3", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00005JPS8", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I could already tell this movie would be a lot of fun from the trailer, but I was surprised just how good it really was.  This could easily be one of my favourite Marvel Comics movies, better even than Spiderman or X-Men (forget Daredevil or Electra or Punisher or Ghost Rider).  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice, a la Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Marvel movies are usually well casted anyway, with the exception of Toby Maguire as Spiderman (he's popular, but I'm of the opinion that James Franco would have been better as the image of Peter Parker from the comics) and Ben Affleck as Daredevil.  Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed-out and real.  Comparisons would abound with Batman - both were born rich, have reputations as playboys, lost their parents, head giant corporations, have no super powers of their own but are good at stocking up on useful gadgets -  but this film is better than any of the Batman flicks for my money (keeping in mind I haven't seen the latest one).  Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.  The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.

Last time I did that, it was when Michael Keaton was cast in the first Batman movie.In both cases, my doubts were groundless. This movie is, in a word, superb. Usually I won't say that, especially about a modern SF film. This time, they got it absolutely right. The pacing is perfect, the characters are actually developed well, the story is well adapted to the 40+ year Iron Man mythos, and the SFX are used to support the story. Usually it's the other way around, with the effects totally overwhelming the rest of the film in order to please fanboy types and kids who just want eye candy.While the film is generally very serious, there are nice touches of both humor and romance. The supporting characters and actors -- and I mean ALL of them -- are excellent. Downey's characterization of Stark, and the gravitas he brings to the character once he realizes what his company has been doing with its weapons, is absolutely spot on. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Obadiah -- as callous a villain as ever walked the earth.Many film companies still seem to think all you need in any science fiction film are blinking lights, big explosions, and female characters in tight spandex. That's what Gene Roddenberry ran into when he tried to make the original Star Trek; the producers literally told him to stick in some blinking lights and start filming. Way too many SF films and TV series have fallen into that same trap.If this movie doesn't get film industry executives to re-think that position, they shouldn't be making movies. Then again, Peter Jackson's LoTR films have already proved SF films can be Oscar material.We need more movies like this.

Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in \"The Incredible Hulk.\")Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, \"Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?\"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.So go see \"Iron Man.\"  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, \"Iron Man\" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.

From humble beginnings, birthing slowly in the unlit corner of the one bedroom apartment and rising from the cheap laminate desk of Richard Matheson -- this character seemed destined for greatness. Theoriginal storyreads painfully, is half cheese, half camp ... but strains the eyes continuously, and has a feel to it that is quite moving and worthy of film, graphic novel or some other type of legacy yet unknown.It would seem unlikely that this movie could be compared in anyway to the original short story / novella that shares the same title. In fact, the title might just be the only similarity. My Chinese wife, when she heard about them remaking this - yet again, said: \"Robert Neville is very repetitively described as a blonde haired, blue eyed white man in the book. Will Smith? I gotta see that.\" Needless to say, the horror and action fan that she is, she was heavily disappointed in this as it seemed to be its own entity, instead of sharing even the most remote similarity with the book or even the previous films in any way conceivable.I guess it would be foolish to state that this is the only film to have deviated so far, but we all know that isn't the truth by a long shot.The Omega Man,The Running Man,Total Recall,Minority Reportand evenBlade Runnerall differ from their original source material - some heavily while others subtly. Who's to say whether this practice is right or wrong? Some of these films are blockbusters while others are heavily dated and total flops. Apparently, Matheson, not only approved of this version, but stated that he thought it was the best so far. Maybe he was referencing the size of the licensing contract and repetitive royalty amounts, surely he couldn't be favouring this over the Charleton Heston version.But what is it about Hollywood that seems to believe that good books just don't translate onto the screen? All the films I previously mentioned are decent books that would've made good direct adaptations, and I can say this confidently because the adjusted adaptations were nothing memorable or impacting, all with the exception of Blade Runner. Giving credit where credit is due,Forrest Gumpmade an interesting adaptation from a sub-par book to an excellent film.  But this type of foolish recklessness is unfortunately more prevalent in the Science-Fiction genre when it comes to adaptations.When I saw this movie at Target, it was on sale for $15.99, but beside it was another version for $24.99 that had the `controversial ending'. So, now, we must either pay an extra ten bucks to see the version where the Vampire Zombies have any level of noticeable intellect and show a glimmer of cunning, or we end up getting both versions for $35, because we just HAVE to see the other version. They used to market these `other versions' for two or three dollars more, which I used to have no problem with, but this is just unforgivable. Double-dipping is understandable in some cases, like with `Donnie Darko'. Numerous years passed until the Director had a chance to make his desired corrections, and when they were made,another DVDwas released. What `I Am Legend' is trying to do is just foolish. The alternate ending is not worth the ten dollars, so save your money. And, sigh ... don't worry what I just told you is nothing close to a spoiler. So if you haven't seen any of the films or ever read the book, you're none the wiser, but hopefully a little more informed.I also found the use of the soundtrack was superficial and annoying. A lot of opportunities were wasted on this film, the soundtrack is probably one of the biggest ones, as it could've equated into more revenue for the producers and distributors of this let down. `28 Days Later', a film that really raised the bar on these type of `chaos reality' films, has a groundbreaking soundtrack with even a few tracks (18 and 20) that are deeply reminiscent of the score that was used in `The Omega Man' and were quite moving. The majority of James Newton Howard's score wasn't even used in the film. The film was overwrought with so much Foley nonsense (action, explosion, sound effects) that the actual composition for this movie had been dialed into the off position or forgotten about entirely. Shame on the mix done in post by the sound board hacks guzzling diet Pepsi. James Newton Howard may have attempted to repeat his success here from the `Batman Begins' soundtrack, but apart from a few memorable moments, the majority of the musical score here is just way too slow, boring and very forgettable.Since I've noted `28 Days Later', let me just say that that `film' probably had a lot of creative impact on this `movie' from its inception or first utterance of \"let's remake `The Omega Man'\". `28 Days Later' and `28 Weeks' later recouped more money than either of their primary budgets, thus sending signals to Hollywood, that these types of films would essentially be good vehicles for their leading stars. The problem here is that even though you put bankable stars into a bankable idea it doesn't necessarily equate to a success. Also '28 Days Later' is probably the high water mark of all horror zombie films. Danny Boyle set the bar so high that other imitators will likely fail to even come within groveling distance.This movie's major flaws were the deviation in the writing and not adhering to enough of the other films or the original novella. Reciting lines from `Shrek' when confronted with other survivors was also another poor use of story, viewer time and appreciation of the material or the genre. The use of the mannequins was a nice touch to the creepy, artsy feel that was readily prevalent in `The Omega Man' but it just wasn't enough to admit that it's a worthy adaptation.

They've absolutely nailed it. My long-going, seemingly insurmountable level of anticipation (three years worth) has been shattered. I am just blown away by the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. Yes, masterpiece.The Nolan brothers and David Goyer created a story that is wonderfully complex and truly gripping. They drew pieces from some of the best parts of Batman classics like The Long Halloween, The Man Who Laughs, The Killing Joke, and surely many others (those are just what came to mind as I watched) and made something possibly even better. This isn't your usual throwaway piece of pop culture entertainment. It's much closer to art. The screenplay says so many intriguing things about humanity. Where is the proverbial line? How far can it be pushed to achieve what is ultimately a good and honorable goal? What is true heroism? When the chips are down, how will people react? These are the questions we're faced with. The Dark Knight doesn't presume to answer them for us, but it challenges us to discover the answers for ourselves. I've read several articles that go so far as to say that they think the film is being political, but I argue otherwise. I can't speak for the filmmakers, so maybe I'm wrong. However, the challenging topics of this film have been explored in countless Batman stories over a span of 70 years. These aren't new ideas to the Batman mythos. If anything, this just proves how relevant Batman continues to be, generation after generation.As for the film's technical aspects, let's talk about the guy most responsible for this film: Christopher Nolan. Can this guy make a bad film? Film by film, Nolan's been cementing himself as one of the great directors of our time. Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige.... these are all amazing, top-tier films. And now, with The Dark Knight, I think everyone is going to finally realize just how good this guy is. And how about Wally Pfister's cinematography? Just gorgeous, gorgeous stuff. The score is very well done, too. It feels like a natural progression of the themes presented in Batman Begins. The new, much talked about one-note-based theme for The Joker works exceptionally well. And, of course, this wouldn't be a Batman film without some great action. Aerial stunts, car chases, explosions, and plenty of fight sequences.... The Dark Knight is a jolt of caffeine that keeps your heart racing from start to finish.While the action sequences and stunts are amazing, the more intimate scenes are the heart of the film. As a prime example, an interrogation scene between The Batman and The Joker honestly just shocked me. I figured their interaction would be good.... but it's much, much better than that. It's amazing to see such great character work in a blockbuster. And not only is it great character work, but the fabled complex relationship between Batman and The Joker is portrayed perfectly. At one point in the film, The Joker says this to Batman: \"You won't kill me, out of some misguided morality, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think we're destined to do this forever.\" Just perfect. Talk about a Batman fan's dream come true....One thing I don't think I can say enough about (and can't really do justice for anyway) is this interpretation of The Joker. After this performance, The Joker is definitely Ledger's. I can't imagine his take ever being topped. The Joker has always been one of the classic literary villains just aching for an accurate big-screen portrayal and man, Heath did it better than I could've ever hoped. He's somehow managed to pull off being funny, sadistic, charismatic, and downright frightening all at once. You can't take your eyes off the guy. And you can't decide whether you want to laugh or throw up when you hear his jokes. And often when he does make you laugh, you feel bad for doing so. That, my friends, is The Joker. And most importantly, this Joker is the perfect opposition for The Batman.... a true and constant threat that challenges him in nearly every way imaginable. Everyone's talking posthumous Oscar for Heath and I sure hope he not only gets nominated, but that he wins. This performance is just that good.I also really, really appreciate the other new central character: Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Eckhart's Harvey is noble, yet cocky and angry enough before the accident to really sell it when Harvey is horribly injured and unleashes his darker side. I have to give some serious credit to the writers here, as well, for adapting the character so well. The tragic side of the character comes across perfectly. The rest of the performances are solid, too. I love the way Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman have elevated these films. These guys are some of the best we have and never seem to disappoint. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a welcome addition to the cast replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Going in, I think I would've preferred Katie Holmes to stick around just for continuity sake, but Gyllenhaal does such a fine job that it's really not an issue.But who is this picture about? The Batman, of course, and they're continuing to get him absolutely right. Christian Bale is just an excellent Bruce Wayne. He's perfected the \"fake Bruce Wayne\" by acting like a silly rich drunkard, womanizer, and egomaniac. He's hilarious a lot of the time, but we never forget just how selfless of an act it really is. He also embodies the real Bruce Wayne which only Alfred and Rachel (and Fox to some degree) truly know. And last, but definitely not least, he's a heck of a Batman. In The Dark Knight, you can tell Batman is maturing. He's becoming the signature Batman who pushes the line of what's decent and acceptable. He walks the razor's edge every night. He's also becoming more self-sufficient. We see him doing more detective work. We see him making technological advances with little or no help from Lucius Fox. As for the title of the film: Batman truly becomes The Dark Knight in this story. The decisions he makes throughout the film show us this progression. And the decision he makes at the end of the film is one of the most refreshing takes on heroism and selflessness that I've ever seen put on film.I think it's safe to say that after this no one will ever look at the \"comic book genre\" the same again (if it's even fair to label this artistic vision as such). This is the father -- or The Godfather, as many critics have said -- of the genre. Look, I love Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Godfather. Those are fantastic films that I could watch over and over again. But I'm going to go ahead and say it: this is the best film I've ever seen. Yes, probably all of those films (and many others) will always have a bigger impact on the history and future of filmmaking, but the quality of this film -- groundbreaking for the genre -- combined with my love of the Batman character and his world leave me completely unable to say otherwise. The film also, of course, dethrones the great Batman Begins as my favorite film of all-time. Begins did a magnificent job exploring the origins of the character, but along with its main theme, \"escalation,\" The Dark Knight just takes things to a whole new level. Finally, we've gotten the film that will almost certainly be met with unanimous agreement as the definitive take on the character.

(a reason I wish I'd waited and seen it at home)Dark Knight raises deep morally rooted questions for which it gives some insight but lets you decide. It leads us through disconcerting circumstances that are no doubt amplified to shine a light to the very essence of our being. Through the darkness there is a morbid bit of comedy which goes right back to mimicking the balance that is an unavoidable part of reality. It plays with themes of balance, fate, fear, chaos, and desire. The way it was written toys with us so cleverly.The stunts are inconsequential in comparison with the performances and writing. However, the acting of Bale and Gyllenhaal make them seem as though they simply worked out okay for the movie but are not perfect. Bale doesn't show us the remorse or the loneliness when the time comes for him to do so.Is it worth seeing in the theater? I would say no, because most of the excitement comes in the dialogue which is truly masterful.

What made this film great was its action, story, and great characters with came together to form a near-perfect film. Usually I don't understand superhero movies; I watched all three Spider-Man movies and I still don't understand, I didn't get the second X-Men movie, and I didn't like Fantastic 4. But The Dark Knight takes a different approach for all movie goers. It's easy to understand (Usually I need a superhero guru of knowledge to explain things to me), it didn't focus too much on relationships (Unlike Spider-Man), and it was more about action than talking.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) is considered a fugitive by Gotham City, and is wanted despite his heroism and getting scum off the street like the mob groups. He eventually forms an alliance with the police and the district attorney Harvey Dent, and even his former girlfriend Rachel, and together they remove several mob groups and hundreds of fugitives are arrested. All seems to be well for a small period of time until a person known only as The Joker shows up and starts killing people, all in return for Batman to reveal himself or more people get killed. Batman becomes the most despised person in Gotham over the fact that people's lives are being taken every day because of him, and there is nothing they can do about it. So Batman must hunt down The Joker and save his friends and the citizens of Gotham City, only this movie doesn't end how you'd predict it to.MUSIC: The music is fantastic and goes great with the already near-perfect film.DISTURBING FACTOR: I never expected a superhero movie to be this creepy and disturbing. There are some scenes which make this film borderline an R-rating for how violent some of them are. Heath Ledger really does a great job at portraying Joker as a complete psychopath who you'd be terrified to come across.ACTION: Lots of shooting, lots of hand-to-hand combat, lots of vehicular mayhem, lots of explosions, and even more! This is one of the best action films I've seen in quite some time.ENTERTAINMENT: This film has a lot of unexpected scenes, even things occurred that I would have never been able to predict. This film is a roller coaster ride of plot twists, adrenaline-rushing action scenes, and it's even suspenseful, all the way to the bizarre ending. This is without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite some time, and is a definite must-see for any movie buffs. You don't even need to be a fan of superheroes to enjoy this kickass movie, just go watch it... NOW!OVERALL: The beginning of the movie is slow with some relationship problems and a few other things, but when the ball starts rolling it doesn't stop and you don't want it to end any time soon.THE GOOD: Great story, great actors, great action, surprisingly disturbing, little focus on relationship problems, and it's an overall kickass movie.THE BAD: The beginning is slow and goes into relationship problems, but it ends quickly at least.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the scene of the movie great?", "id": "34fc9f970b23e2750d42b252cfccaafb", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The Dark Knight (2008)Action, Crime, Drama, 152 minutesDirected by Christopher NolanStarring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Aaron EckhartI don't like superhero movies as a rule and only watched The Dark Knight so that I could confirm my belief that all the hype was unjustified. To my surprise, I ended up loving the experience.There are a number of reasons why I don't usually watch the genre. The characters are often shallow and we don't know their true origin and motivations. Acting is cheesy and deliberately over the top. The need for humor means that I'm likely to be assaulted by childish jokes. The plot is there as an excuse for cool special effects and a lot of action. In short, I don't believe in the characters or the world in which they live.The Dark Knight overcomes all of those problems and delivers something special.The characters are far from shallow. After seeing the movie, I made a point of seeing Batman Begins, in which Nolan shows us how Bruce Wayne became Batman. We see the training that allows him to fight criminals. His wealth enables him to develop weapons, vehicles and protective clothing that could actually exist. The acting is superb and many of the cast are Oscar-winners or nominees. Instead of making The Joker an unbelievable character such as the one depicted by Jack Nicholson in 1989, Nolan and Ledger invent a character who could be walking around in New York or anywhere else. He's psychotic, but we understand his twisted logic. When he makes a threat, we believe that it's possible and that he could pull it off.Nolan's world is totally logical and could easily exist in reality.The Dark Knight has enough thrills and action to satisfy fans of the genre, but it's much more than that. It works as a character study and as a police procedural. It's also a thriller, with elements of romance.If there's one movie that transcends the genre, The Dark Knight is it.", "qas": [{"question": "How inmersive is the ending scene?", "id": "d17d3508e8a14eff963afcb8e6979887", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "So, I finally saw The Dark Knight.This film attempts to do a lot. On some fronts it utterly succeeds. On several, though, it is blithely simple minded.The action is spectacular enough, but I don't really buy into the nearly perfect timing of everything, particularly around the character of the Joker. For those who don't know this film the Joker is deftly painted as Satan incarnate, and his resulting efforts at destruction are fully befitting the Evil One himself.But, the puzzle is a little too machine like, a little too perfect. There's nothing earthy about this film, as was in Batman Begins. There was far and away much more being attempted in TDK, and because they tried to do so much they actually did too much. The film suffers from repeated episodes of the bad guy doing bad things to good people over and over. I realize that in reality life very much emulates that, but in a two and half hour film I don't need to get the point more than once. Not that tragedy isn't wanted for understanding, but seriously how many versions of light versus darkness must we endure in order to finish a story?Perhaps I'm not far enough into comics to understand what's going on here, but I got the distinct impression that the writers of the film didn't want us focusing on Batman or the Joker, but on ourselves, and I came away feeling clipped like someone had just tackled me by the ankles with their feet. It just didn't come off well. It was very good action entertainment, and it packed a message anyone over the age of 14 should be able to grasp, but it was in no way worth the $500 million it earned at the box office. I think the American audience has lost it's respect for real art. What we want now are special effects and intricate plots and methods, but no actual substance. At least that's what we are getting. Films that attempt to do too much have been en vogue since Titanic came out.Perhaps I am too much of an old school entertainee. But, really, watch the original Star Wars again and recognize why these films were so good to begin with. That film did plenty with a not so obvious cast, unusual artistry in the production of action, and a budget that went for somewhat less than $20 million, even well done for 1977. And, the Star Wars enterprise could have easily taken on the concepts presented in this Batman film. In many ways it did, but the majesty of it is still unparalleled in film to this very day.

No more commercials, no more hacked up episodes in syndication; it's a wonderful thing.  The thirteen episodes that comprise the first season collection have never looked or sounded better.

And hearing the Simpsons in 5.1 channel surround adds a whole new dimension to your viewing.To my mind, though, the best thing about this collection is getting to see the entire episode, rather than what's left after it's re-edited for syndication.  I came across scenes and I had completely forgotten about, or that I had never seen at all, some of which had me laughing out loud.  It seems that much of the more oblique, dry humor was removed, and having it back makes these episodes even funnier.The only downside to this collection is the extras.  I suppose if you are an animator, or are interested in the process of animation, you might find them interesting.  I found much of the archival material rather dull though, and the piece on the origins and history of the Simpsons was far too short.

High art? Spiritually infused with symbolism? EvidentlyI needed to be drinking something stronger than I was when Ifirst viewed this film. Maybe there was a method behind thefilm's references to absynthe after all.Two things drive a good film:  plot and character. When bothare developed properly and the right actors are chosen, moviemagic occurs. For me, this film had the potential to createmagic, but failed miserably due to a directorial lack of focus andunbelievably poor casting. To be sure, the sets are grand andthe costumes visually stunning. However, the choppy editing,sophomoric musical score and trite story line would have been farmore palatable--and forgivable--had it not been for the deplorableacting.Many reviews have cited Nicole Kidman as the \"sexy\" \"erotic\"\"passionate\" centerpiece of the film. For me, this tall, skinny,anemic woman with protruding gums and motionless facialfeatures had all the sex appeal of a wet noodle. When I think ofcourtesans, I picture smouldering, voluptuous women whoseeroticism stems from a raw and steely core hardened by worldlyexcess and exploitation. Women who are a bit rough around the edges.Kidman and Luhrmann needed to take a page out of Jessica Rabbit'sbook and watch Dr. Frank N. Furter come down the elevator shaft a fewtimes before fashioning Kidman's high class [...], who was too busylooking \"pretty\" on a swing to truly afford the character any depth or soul.Adding to Satine's lack of proper characterization is Kidman's lousyacting. Her performance first begins to completely unravel during the\"Rhythm of the Night\" scene, in which she awkwardly chirps, trills, andtrapses around the club shaking her ostrich feathers in the face of thelead. It's hard to determine just who she's channeling here, but it appearsto be a combination of Carmen Miranda, Gloria Estefan, and Lucille Ballon crack. The film unravels further as she rolls around on the floor in somefake, cheesy, orgasmic trance as Ewan McGregor recites cliched lines from\"Your Song,\" which supposedly send her into some freakish sexual frenzy.(At this point in the film her accent is quasi-American but will morph intosomething like British later in the film).Continuing scenes are intermittantly punctuated by a lot of fake hacking andcoughing and breaking out into song, which showcases a weak voice by traditionalblockbuster musical standards. (In other words, your not gonna get the goosebumps that break out when you hear Jennifer Hudson sing.) After a few extremelycontrived crying scenes at the end of the film (one of which must have relied onglycerine and amonia), Kidman pulls out a dying scene so ridiculous and prolongedthat I thought the protagonist was going to die before she did (there's a cinematicopportunity that was missed!). The only dying scene that rivals the cheesiness ofKidman's death in Moulin Rouge! is Sophia Coppola dying in Godfather III. Folks,it's that bad.Ewan McGregor as the lovestruck poet is not entirely terrible, but he'snot spectacular either. Throughout the film, the young man in the monkeysuit attempts to win the affections of Kidman's holy [...] (archetypes,people, archetypes) with trite endearments such as.....breaking into song.His vocal talents are a bit stronger than Kidman's, although the delivery issomewhat flat. While I truly do feel his anguish at the end of the film whenSatine chokes out her last breath, I do not witness the incredible chemistrybetween the two actors so many others do. For example, at the crescendo ofthe \"Elephant Medley\" when the two are facing each other in the entrance tothe, umm, \"Elephant Room,\" their hands are at their sides while they're singing!At a moment when both lovers needed to passionately embrace at thecompletion of a very important medley that tells their \"STORY,\" the actorswere too busy concentrating on hitting the high notes of the songs to staycompletely in character. Knitpicky, you say? For me, this obvious oversightepitomizes the lack of passion and chemistry between the two throughout thefilm. They do not, by any means, raise the room temperature with their sizzle.As for John Leguizamo's midget artist with a speech impediment,I found the performance goofy and embarrassing. All anyone cando is pray that his \"To Wong Foo\" days are not completely over andthat he hasn't completely degenerated to just a second rate supportinggoon in high budget disasters like this one.For those of you still on the fence about seeing this movie, I heartilyrecommend you do. A film that invites this much discussion andpassionate debate is worth seeing, if for no other reason than tobecome part of the ongoing dialogue. Is this film phenomenal? Hardly.Did it deserve an Oscar? Please. Do the lead actors do the story, setsand costumes justice? No. Did it convince many members of film-goingaudiences over the last seven years that all they need is love?

It's not what I expected of a so-called \"cult\" film, or even a sci-fi or troubled-teenager genre flick.  Now, having some more time and patience, I gave this Director's Cut the careful attention it deserves, and the rewards are considerable.  The 26-year-old Kelly shoots movies like a pro if not an art movie director.  None of the \"shock editing\" that we've become so accustomed and desensitized to.  Instead, he favors long takes, slow pacing, and some of the most fluid camera movement in recent memory.  Moreover, he has a true artist's eye for shot composition, using the 2.5:1 anamorphic lens to maximum aesthetic and narrative effect in practically every frame.All the same, I've just ordered the earlier, shorter version to see if some of the apparent flaws I noticed in the Director's Cut are lessened.  For one, some of the scenes are overly formulaic and obvious--both in the scripting and filming.  The hypocritical, self-righteous characters are played quite loudly, bordering on flat caricature.  Moreover, Kelly pulls gratuitous tricks like mocking them with \"fast action\" shooting (whereas the youthful romantic hero and heroine, of course, are shot in slow motion).  Drew Barrymore seems to occupy unnecessary screen time toward the end of the film, tilting this POV film to her situation rather than Darko's.  Also, all the time-travel nonsense, which I understand has been exaggerated in both this version and on a Johnny Darko website, could be reduced to the betterment of the film, imo.  Still, the script is light years ahead of juvenilia time-wasters like Dazed and Confused (unless you're a teenager).Although Kelly talks about the film as Reagan-era social satire (an easy target, since the 80s were a rerun of the repressive 1950s), the movie is less about an historical period than about other movies: in fact, it's a collection of mirrors reflecting other movies.  Several shots of Darko recall Norman Bates, when we learn about his dual identity at the end of Psycho.  Darko's alter ego, Frank, recalls Jeffrey Beaumont's dark twin, Frank (Dennis Hopper), in Lynch's Blue Velvet.  The playing off of psychological vs. chronological time, challenging the viewer to decide which temporal dimension he is currently viewing, reprises Lynne's remarkable film, \"Jacob's Ladder.\"  And the time-travel theme owes less to \"Back to the Future\" than \"serious\" science fiction movies like \"12 Monkeys\" and the 30-minute influential French film classic by Chris Marker: \"La Jetee.\"But most strikingly, the film echoes the central theme of Burgess/Kubrick's \"Clockwork Orange,\" where Alex and his Droogs talk Nadsat and commit rape and violence to assert their free choice and humanity in a world that threatens to \"condition\" them, transforming them into deterministic machines.  Two key moments in Darko: the intercut chapter with the quote, \"The Manipulated Living will do anything to save themselves from oblivion,\" and Darko's conversation with his science teacher, who explains to him that if he were able to know his future, he would have a choice to accept or avoid it, which means that destiny would come to an end.This is a film that celebrates choice--not just its characters' but the viewers'.  Moviegoers need not subject themselves to mindless surrogate experiences in virtual reality, pretending that loneliness and fear are more imagined than real. The attentive viewer is likely to feel that the disturbed teen protagonist has made some significant choices which, however risky or even deadly, have prepared him to face the difficult circumstances of life that none of us can control.Finally, this is a director who definitely knows Catcher in the Rye, infusing his main character with so much of Holden's spirit (obsession with sex and death, impatience with phoniness and pretense, adoption of grandiose thinking and a savior complex) that Donny Darko becomes the \"everychild\" in each of us, more recognizable than we may be inclined to admit.", "qas": [{"question": "How is film?", "id": "6f2d875d1518d610311bf618556f57c8", "answers": [{"text": "this film a few years ago", "answer_start": 17}, {"text": "remarkable film", "answer_start": 2393}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00005Y1NF", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The Next Generation is my favorite Star Trek series, slightly ahead of the original series.

Still, there are several bonus features at the end that go a long way toward explaining this second Star Trek series.

Being an avid Star Wars fan, I was excited to see any Star Wars movie, but I suspected this would be as disappointing as the Phantom Menace. WRONG! Although this doesn't even come close to the great casting and story lines and sheer art of the first three Star Wars series, it was WAY better than Phantom Menace for the following reasons: 1) This movie included LESS Jar-Jar, which, despite initial heavy marketing for the first movie, the character was found by the general consensus to be REALLY annoying. 2) This movie demonstrated some of the political turmoil behind the original Star Wars movies. 3) You get to see some of what led Anakin to turn over to the Dark Side. Finally, the special effects were really good!It was not 4 or 5 stars because the actors that were cast in this movie (as well as The Phantom Menace) are all well known for other cinematic accomplishments, and it was hard to believe that they were supposed to be these other characters.  They should have casted lesser-known actors, in my opinion.  Also, the plot about the clones was weak, to me.But, note well- the fight-scene with Yoda by itself makes the movie worth watching. It was action packed, entertaining, and even a little bit funny.

And were surprised along the way.  Plus the story was on a smaller scale, and yes less special effects and more story developmentNow in saying all that the only thing I really found wrong with  \"Clones\", was the way Lucus treated the romance, between Padme and Anakin, it seemed rushed and fake.  Now I know why, in the DVD the have the deleted scenes that you can view.  Over Half the scenes build the relationship and romance between the two.  Which I feel is very important in the story.  But Lucus decided to streemline for time and action purposes.  In doing that he really neglected the heart of the story, Anakin's and Padme's love for each other.Plus I think both The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter series remind us of what the Star Wars series used to be, a place we can get lost in.

Yet again, we`re in the middle of a trilogy.Ten years has passed since the events of \"Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace\". Anakin is now a 19 year old Jedi padawan, and Amidala has left her position as the queen of Naboo to serve the senate. We`re also facing a cooler, less annoying Jar-Jar Binks (but don`t worry. He`s just on screen for 5-10 minutes!). Obi-Wan Kenobi is the same person as always, a worried man with a tough sense of humour. The Republic is still in crisis. Many solar systems is trying to separate from the republic. Under the lead of the mysterious count Dooku (yeah, right , COUNT Dooku, played by legendary horror veteran Christopher Lee), the separatists plan to kill senator Amidala. Anakin and Obi Wan are now sent out by the Jedi council to protect her, and this leads into many fearsome events, especially as Anakin is more and more on his way to the Dark Side.I think that \"Attack of The Clones\" is a lot better than \"The Phantom Menace\". After having seen the first film I was worried. I was thinking \"Well, it`s Ok to have one bad Star Wars film. But if the second appears to be [bad], I don`t think the prequel trilogy will ever reach up to the standards of the old one\"Fortunatley, Lucas hasn`t written the script himself this time. He`s co-written it with Jonathan Hales (who also wrote the action flick \"The Scorpion King\"). This film is more in the spirit of the original trilogy than \"The Phantom Menace\", and it`s full of memorable action sequences and has lots of fun lines, which comes close to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" which is may be the best Star Wars film in my opinion.This movie is much more matured and serious than \"The Phantom Menace\" - for example, there is much more love and serious drama this time.This could very well be the darkest and most serious Star Wars movie so far.Finally, we are also given the answers of questions that has previously been hidden. For example - why don`t the jedi discover the dark lord of the sith is controlling the republic, what did the Storm Troopers came from and how did Anakin`s enormous hate really began?While the last movie felt more like an adventure film, this one feels more like a typical Star Wars movie.I also think that the actors are well chosen - the newcomer Hayden Christensen is excellent as the grown-up Anakin Skywalker (while Jake Lloyd [was not]!)In fact, he`s one of the best actors since Harrison Ford to appear in a Star Wars film!Ewan McGregor is great as the always skeptical and carefull Obi-Wan Kenobi and Christopher Lee is a fun surprise as the new villain ( I think this is funny : he`s playing a real bad guy in both Star Wars II and Lord of the Rings II this year!) and Samuel L. Jackson swings his lightsaber with the same coolness as when he played \"Shaft\".Something which I have noticed recently is that the Star Wars characters never changes. They always have the same personality. This is making a typical film analysis  of Star Wars impossible!Anyhow, this isn`t the best Star Wars movie out there. I think that there is simply TOO MUCH action to make it as memorable as the original trilogy.The 30-minute final battle sequence sometimes seems more like  marketing for action figures than a real movie!And the sequence where Yoda swings his lightsaber for the first time is fun, but it`s sometimes feels made just for the fans to have someone laughing at. To sum it up : the action sequences are too many and too long!They should have taken even more feelsome and serious moments and cut away may be 15 minutes or so of the action sequences.But except for that, I`m actually quite happy with this movie. This movie simply brings us a new hope for the Star Wars saga - Lucas is definitly on the right way, but he`s not really there yet. It feels like a pity you have to wait for another three years to see what the final chapter of the saga is like.

However after talking to many people who have watched the film and reading other reviews, it seems i'm not the only one who spotted bad acting.  The worst performance came from Hayden Christensen, especially on the emotional scenes.  I have read that George Lucas was initially going to take on Leornardo DiCaprio to play Anakin, which in my opinion was a much better choice.  Not only DiCaprio looks like the boy in Phantom Menace, but he is a better actor and would've held a stronger screen presence.  Surprisingly, Ewan's performance wasn't as strong in this one, as it was in the Phantom Menace, I think maybe he was too relaxed in his role.  I think Lucas focused so much on special effects and the digital yoda, that he forgot what makes a good film in the first place, and thats 'performance.'  After watching the documentaries on the dvd, Christopher Lee said that despite the fact that the effects have taken over a fair bit, there is still a strong need for performance, however since Lee's character was played by a body-double in most of his scenes, I find this ironic.Now the positive aspects of the film.  Well done ILM, for bringing digital Yoda to life.  Superb scene, with Yoda fighting with his light saber, but I dont think this was enough to save the film from its demise.  The soundtrack was the strong hold of the picture, I think John Williams scored superbly, bringing the feel of love into the story.The film wasn't all bad, but you would expect better from a Star Wars film, and the bad acting did let the film down dramatically.

Now fully digital instead of a puppet, the little green guy gets to show just why he has this reputation as a Jedi master, with the usual aid of Frank Oz's voice.  Also, the main villian , Count Dooku, is played by the wonderful Christopher Lee with his usual style and grace.  Ewan McGregor is solid as an older Obi-Wan Kenobi.  As always, the special effects are captivating.  However, with all these great assets, the film still has its share of clunky moments.  The romantic sup-plot becomes tediously weak as the film goes on.  While Natalie Portman's Amidala is as lovely as ever, her performance lacks a degree of passion needed to be truely convincing.

Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of \"holes\" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and \"Attack of the Clones\" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the \"Ultimate Enhanced Version\" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch \"Serenity\" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of \"Mannequin\" to \"Annakin\" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story.", "qas": [{"question": "How is this filmso good?", "id": "c15409818ffdc00edc0e03e6334a51cd", "answers": [{"text": "Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, {"context": "First of all, I couldn't decide whether to give three or four stars. I finally decided four just could not be justified, so it's really more like 3.5/5 from me. So, as you know by now, this is not a great movie, but it's better than Episode I by a considerable margin.  The special effects are great and seamless (moments in Episode I and especially the ones added to the 3 original SW films were quite flawed). The asteroid chase and rain planet and Yoda's lightsaber duel were all memorable. I noticed some grainy scenes in the theater, but everything looks good -- almost TOO good -- on the DVD. The plot this time around is less convoluted and more coherent and flows more naturally from scene to scene. The video and surround audio are both reference quality on this DVD, and there's enough extras to keep the most ardent fans busy for a long time. 'Nuff said about that -- no complaints at all there.But alas, the characters and their interactions with each other, is the film's downfall, due to poor acting, directing, and screenwriting. I appreciated trying to add some romantic facets, but the dialogue is laughably bad in many scenes, and certain actors are so blandly disinterested they cannot overcome the material to convince us otherwise. Hayden Christiansen is simply awful, there is no other way to put it. The annoying, forgettable, hokey child actor in Episode I has been replaced by an annoying, forgettable, hokey teenage actor here. Natalie Portman is only slightly less wooden than in Episode I, which must be blamed on the direction, because in other places she's proved herself to be a competent actor. And although I generally like him, I never quite bought Samuel Jackson as a Jedi Knight. He goes through the entire film with an odd look on his face and I get the distinct feeling he was always on the verge of breaking into laughter reading his lines. Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor are the only actors worthy of the roles, along, of course, with the vocal talent that gives the CG Yoda life. Thankfully the insipid Jar Jar Binks is less prominent in this film, although even after five seconds he begins to grate on you. I guess he had to put in an appearance so they could pump another action figure into Toy 'R' Us stores around the world. As for the direction, Lucas needs to just give it up and let someone who knows what they are doing handle it. He is NOT a great director. His two best films, Empire and Raiders, were directed by someone other than him. There was some great screen chemistry in the original Star Wars but it must have just been stars-aligning dumb luck, since he has never been able to reproduce it since.Reading this you might think I hated this movie, but I actually didn't. You just need to let yourself become a kid again for a few hours and ignore the bad things. Then it just becomes fun, and if you are expecting something more from a Star Wars film then you aren't being realistic. The first three Star Wars films also had lots of bad acting, bad screenwriting, uneven direction, cheesy special effects, and a ridiculous plot but we never saw that, because we were young and unjaded and had no preconceptions or expectations for the films to live up to, and we were experiencing instead of analyzing as we watched.

With the annoying Jar Jar Binks, a child actor who was in over his head, poor pacing, and wooden acting and dialogue, I was less than impressed, despite being a big Star Wars fan.  Apparently, so many others were let down that it somehow resulted in \"The Matrix\" being lauded as the \"new hope\" of epic sci-fi, despite that movie falling far short of the standards set by Star Wars.  When George Lucas promised (or threatened?) that Episode II would be \"Titanic in space\", my interest waned even more.  However, as the promotional media emerged, my interest picked up again as it appeared that there would at least be some good action sequences.  So how did the unfortunately named \"Attack of the Clones\" fare?First the bad news, and it's not pretty.  The dialogue is, for the most part, not good at all, with some terribly blatant exposition that is not needed at all.  The acting doesn't fare well either, generally speaking.  Anakin Skywalker(who is now 10 years older) is now played by Hayden Christiansen, instead of Jake Lloyd.  Unfortunately, while his efforts are commendable, Hayden obviously is ill at ease in this role, and co-star Natalie Portman exhibits zero enthusiasm during the movie.  As these two are supposed to be the \"romantic leads\", the resulting lack of chemistry cripples the emotional core of the movie.  Samuel Jackson's performance as Mace Windu is similarly off, and there is some other poor acting by various bit players.  Thus, the weight of the movie ends up having to be borne by the acting chops of Ewan McGregor, Temuera Morrison, Ian McDiarmid, and Christopher Lee, who all do manage to perform in a professional manner.  (Of particular note is the initial terse face to face meeting between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett).  Still, there are also some lingering pacing issues, most notably related to scenes surrounding Anakin and Padme in the middle of the movie.The good news is that the movie works on a \"macro\" level, as far as the over-arching Star Wars storyline and universe are concerned.  Helping this aspect are several dynamic action and set pieces, which include a \"car chase\" in the skies of the city planet of Coruscant, a trip to the rain-drenched water planet Kamino, complete with a faceoff between Obi-Wan and bounty hunter Jango Fett, a spaceship chase through the rings of Geonosis, a confrontation between a couple hundred Jedi and an army of droids, and a massive battle sequence between the Separatist droid army and an army of clones.  Topping off the movie is a lightsaber battle involving Christopher Lee's Count Dooku and Yoda.The movie's primary strength is developing the events which lead to the much stronger Episode III.  In the 10 years since the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo was foiled, a Separatist movement has gained traction among hundreds of worlds in the Republic, fueled by the enigmatic Count Dooku.  While Chancellor Palpatine presides over a divided Senate, assassination attempts against former Queen (now Senator) Padme Amidala lead the Jedi to assign Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to protect her.  A bounty hunter's failed attempt on Padme's life leads Obi-Wan to the distant world of Kamino, where he finds a surprising development: an army of clones is being raised for the Republic, as per the orders of a now-dead Jedi Council member.  Meanwhile, Padme and Anakin head to Naboo, where Anakin's nightmares eventually lead him to take Padme to Tattoine with him to find his mother.  Anakin's search leads him to the Lars homestead, where his mother's husband tells him that the Tusken Raiders kidnapped her.  When Anakin finds his mother dying after being tortured by the Sandpeople, his anger results in a wanton act of mass murder.  Obi-Wan's investigation leads him to the world of Geonosis, where he discovers that Count Dooku has enlisted the forces of an old foe, among others, to help the Separatists prepare for war on the Republic.  With this threat looming, the Chancellor is given emergency powers (proposed in the Senate by none other than Jar-Jar Binks, who is mercifully absent for most of the movie), and the available Jedi scramble to Geonosis to try to stop Dooku.  The final 40 or so minutes of the movie manage to make up for the shortcomings liberally sprinkled throughout the proceedings.Visually speaking, this movie is incredible, albeit a bit artificial looking.  The live action characters don't always seem to mesh with the computer-generated backdrops, but the color saturation is brilliant, and sets the tone well.  The transfer to DVD was done very well, apparently being a direct digital print.  The music alternates between magnificently appropriate, and ridiculously purile.  The sound effects are fairly standard Star Wars, although there are a couple of really bizarre and out of place sounds.  The DVD release itself has the typical wealth of Star Wars extras, including deleted scenes and trailers.  The commentary track is remarkably boring, to the point that a friend of mine actually said it literally puts him to sleep.It does pain me to give this movie only 3 stars, as I enjoyed it, especially when the Battle of Geonosis erupted.  The slow unfolding of the plot to turn the Republic into the Empire is an important arc in the Star Wars saga.  But objectively speaking, the acting and dialogue were bad enough to cripple the film in a number of ways, and I have to try to be honest with viewers.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you probably should get this, if you haven't already.

For my birthday as an early present this year, I purchased the DVD, hoping that maybe I had just been overly-critical in the theater.Good news or bad news first? I'll start with the good.The good parts of Attack of the Clones are GOOD parts--the arena scene (with all those rockin' Jedi), Kamino and the inhabitants (I love their eyes), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the Yoda-Count Dooku lightsaber duel,and many others as well. I found that though I loved the puppet Yoda more profusely, the CGI one works just fine with me--he is still Yoda! And the extras on the second DVD are wonderful.Many behind-the-scenes features opened my eyes to really how MUCH work they do for Star Wars. Seeing how much they used blue-screen as well made me appreciate and look up to the actors more--it takes skill to stare at something that isn't there and talk to it and be convincing!The bad:I have to say, also, like countless others before me: The romance was AWFUL. I always admired Padme in Episode I--she was a spectacular leader at only 14-years-old, and she was mature and cool when put in a hard place. But now--instead of maturing as I hoped she would, it seems that Padme Amidala has digressed, becoming childish, reckless and impulsive, more of a spoiled child than a senator. But Anakin is even worse--he disobeyed Obi-Wan at every turn and says such wooden lines as 'It's not fair!\" and \"Obi-Wan is jealous!\". Frankly, I thought, the WORLD is not fair--grow up! He was overly childish and a horrible whiner, and his acting was very wooden in certain spots, entirely hard to believe. Some of the love scenes get entirely painful--the dialogue is just horrible (I've never heard worse proclaimations of love) and their actions make you want to give them a good smack.Another thing--how did Padme suddenly turn into the Britney Spears of the Star Wars galaxy? Almost all of her clothes (except for a few choice lovely ones) are mid-riff bearing, and the black-corset thing!? Let's just say she needed it to cover a little more of her skin. I really looked down on this--whoever designed the wardrobe should have though of the effect it would have on young girls. I think it's really important for Star Wars to stay the way it was, clean and right and with no unnecessary sexual indication.It disappointed me, to say the least, but I still think that the parts that are good are true Star Wars moments. It's quite easy to just fast-foward through the gooey love scenes anyway. ;D", "qas": [{"question": "What does it tell us about the dialogue of this movie?", "id": "ea874dd3840fbb86babfc49601380895", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The expectation for this film was incredible.

I was so confused at the end of the first movie as to WHY there was all these battles, and what did it really matter in the end? Well, it doesn't really matter. That's what this movie showed us. These two films are totally disconnected in plot, except the personal strain going through them. (Maybe 3 will answer questions and loose ends, but I doubt it.) The acting was weak, and Anakin was more concerned with getting his way with Padme, rather than seeming genuinely in love with her. I realise that these two felt a passionate, carefree love in comparison with the more mature Han/Leia love, but the downright lust and danger of Anakin was annoying and disturbing.

I recommended the film to a relative and we saw it together. Then I saw it with a friend, then with another, and so on, until I had seen the (still-unsubtitled) film ten times. I eagerly awaited the next (fifth) episode (The Empire Strikes Back, 1980), and impatiently anticipated the \"third\" (sixth) episode (The Return of the Jedi, 1983). Afterward known as the Star Wars Trilogy, I was thrilled with the action and adventure, although the quasi-religious \"Force\" they talked about seemed irrelevant to all that, if not downright ridiculous.Then something happened. Maybe it was a sequel too far. Maybe I got older, maybe the characters weren't as interesting, or maybe the films just got more and more ridiculous. By 1999, when Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came along, I had had enough of that George Lucas world a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. In this latest installment of his tired series, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, I was disappointed to find no image, no line of dialog, that didn't disappear from my memory as soon as it dissolved from the screen.Oh, yes, Episode II is a technical marvel: here, the sets are totally computer-generated; the aliens are truly inventive and all computer-generated; the visual effects are seamless and brilliantly computer-generated. I even liked seeing tiny Yoda dancing with his light saber in battle with the evil Count Drac-, er, Count Dooku (played with CGI face by Christopher Lee!). But I felt double-crossed by the dialog and cheated by the characters. Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi - played memorably in Episodes 4-6 by the late Sir Alec Guinness - was at least entertaining to watch. But the love dance between the maturing Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and the Princess Padm&eacute; Amidala (Natalie Portman, who actually has talent) was entirely bland and unconvincing. Get a clue, kids: love means passion.The Star Wars franchise George Lucas created inhabits a godless-yet-spiritual universe, with an uneasy alliance between technology and a pop-theology. Among people made uncomfortable by human progress and the dizzying advance of technology, perhaps this is more comfortable - also more masculine, that is, more appealing to male teenagers and less intellectually demanding - than the more explicitly god-free universe of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, however cool it is to see Jedi priests swing their light sabers. Personally, I prefer Trek to Wars, principally because I see more potential for improving the human condition with technology than with theology - even the generic, anti-intellectual, anti-technology, anti-progress variety called The Force.That is my objection to Star Wars in general. As to Attack of the Clones in particular, I see Lucas's deep investment in Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) that might as well be cartoons for all they help the film. I am not opposed to CGI per se. But I do think it should work to elucidate, not invalidate, the story and the characters. The subtitle contains less poetry than truth.", "qas": [{"question": "Does this story is good enough?", "id": "6f0bf3be09532c12c26980e3199246bf", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "For the week leading up to its release, the word from the advanced critics screenings seemed to unanimously agree that Attack of the Clones is a significantly more adult film than the reproachable Phantom Menace.  Personally, I see the only achievement of this film is that Lucas and Co. has graduated from infantile to pre-adolescence.  Maybe by the time the last of this unfortunate trio is made, we'll have a film that I could have mildly enjoyed when I was fourteen years old.  But at present, what we seem to have in George Lucas is a director who is completely and totally in denial of a few simple truths:1. The movie going public is not quite as taken with the mystery of why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader as he is (and don't believe for a second that this is not a mystery to George because clearly he's making this [stuff] up as he goes along).2.  That technological advances alone are no reason to revive a beloved series.  Allow me to explain:  I go over and over in my mind this one question - Why are these movies being made?  I can't help but think that Lucas, being essentially the founder of an effects studio more than anything else, had some tinge of regret that he made Star Wars so long ago when the effects capabilities were limited.  Clearly this is true... why else tinker with the original films and produce the remastered editions.  But that wasn't enough:  so, under the most misguided notion of all time (that papa could come and teach these whipper snappers a thing or two about making an effects driven movie) he came out of his ranch and started writing and \"directing\" this movie.3.  Sure, Boba Fett made for a cool action figure... but I (and other star wars fans) could have lived a thousand years and never would have had an ounce of curiosity about the childhood and motivations for that character.4.  There is a such thing as beating the audience over the head with a setup.  I'm willing to except conflict between Obi Wan and Anakin, especially provided that there's an entire film left for this conflict to hit it's peak.  Did we really need to sit through a couple of hours of whining, disobedience and scoldings for this dynamic to be present.5.  Getting back to number 1:  Alright, so the character of Anakin Skywalker is not ready to be a Jedi... that's what we're getting at here, right?  And what are the Jedi -supposedly a terribly select order of individuals who have mastered the force (matter, mind, etc. etc.).  What would have been an interesting character (but somewhat challenging for a writer (which Lucas barely qualifies as) to do) is if Anakin were a hell of a guy, far better than most people (in maturity et al) but had some fault(s) that the vast majority of the audience share and it was that which led to his demise.  The sad thing would be if this were actually what Lucas was attempting.  As it stands we're left with a character who is not ready to make a mature 12 year old, so as an audience member over twelve, I have a hard time seeing the need for any dark side to seduce him.Lastly...  Oh, the hell with it... why am I sitting here putting so much thought into slamming this tripe when it's creator put no thought into writing and directing it.  I guess what I want is impossible to receive and that is for the people who claim they enjoy this [stuff] to come back from the edge of sanity and try to help in the effort to make Lucas seek some professional filmmaking help before he films Episode three.  But it's too late... I'm pretty sure I already know how Episode 3 will go down... because the fence sitters have said something to the extent that \"Oh yeah, the movie sucked but the light saber fights were cool,\" we `re going to end up getting a mortal kombat style picture that is basically an overblown tournament of light saber duels.  After all, Count Dooku has to die, dido Mace Windu, the unfortunate approval for the Yoda fight scene probably means he'll pick up the saber again.  And we all know that Anakin and Obi Wan have to go at it again.  So far we're up to four and that's not including the fact that many other Jedi must perish and who knows what the Emperor will be up to.  The tragic thing is this will prove much more interesting the mess of plot holes and demeaning dialogue that episodes one and two have provided.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the plot at times?", "id": "c342977c3ebe91c37730821820d31f7f", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B0000640VJ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Wes Anderson's third film, \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" is nothing short of amazing and was easily the best film of 2001. Why it wasn't nominated for more than Best Original Screenplay at this year's Oscars is beyond me. The same went for his sophomore effort (and what I feel is his best film of the three) \"Rushmore.\"One of many of Anderson's gifts lies in his appreciation of and ability to identify deadpan humor. My three favorite moments of the film are when Richie suffers a breakdown at his tennis match and tosses his racquet at the returned ball he lightly served over the net in the first place, when Chas holds a mock fire drill and tells his boys that they all would have died, including their dog, because it took them four and a half minutes to get out of the house, and when Raleigh St. Clair replies to the question \"Can the boy tell time?\" with \"Heavens, no.\"He also has the uncanny ability of accompanying his films with the perfect music (though he has been ostracized for not including certain songs that appear in his films on the actual soundtrack.) He did it in \"Rushmore\" with British Invasion songs and he doesn't falter here. The absolute best moment of the film (in a depressing, psychotic kind of way) is when Richie attempts to kill himself by slicing his wrists. The reason for this wholly rests on the fact that the entire montage was accompanied by Elliot Smith's haunting song \"Needle in the Hay.\"The other reason Anderson gets good marks is because of the fabulous ensemble cast. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are all at their best here.Kudos to everyone involved in this film; it is sure to gain classic status years from now.

I own the DVD and have seen it several times, and each time it fills me with a kind of wonder.

But here's a test: if you, like the films main character, can take joy from life's simple pleasures (like the way your hand feels sinking into a sack of dried beans, the way street markets sound and smell, the absurdity of a horse running with the Tour de France), then this is a simple pleasure you don't want to miss.As far as the quality and value of this film, I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted here except to say \"Yes! Yes! Me too!\"An interesting side note: the more I watch the film, the more little cultural references and word plays I catch. I'm sure the film is full of them, but I think it would take a native French speaker or long-time Paris resident to catch them all (understanding them is not necessary to enjoy the film; they're a bonus).One I caught on the most recent viewing on TV (my French is sketchy, but seeing it with Italian subtitles rather than the English helped) is a play on words by Hippolito, the failed writer in the cafe, who comments that the cafe's regulars speak about the weather out of fear of the passing time. In French, \"temps\" means both \"time\" and \"weather.\"Similarly, the grocer Collignon tells Amelie to contact his mother to discover the name of her apartment's former tennent. He says, \"Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer.\" That translates to \"She has a memory like an elephant, a sea elephant\" -- a reference to a manatee or an seal. But the point is the way Collignon stresses \"mer\" (which means \"ocean\"), which sounds the same as \"mere\" (which means \"mother\").I also noticed that the voice over used when Amelie imagines the television retrospective of her life is from the same person who does the television commentary for the funerals of France's rich, famous, and powerful. I peaked at the credits and found that he is Frederic Mitterrand, the nephew of the late prime minister.The last might be a stretch, but on my last trip to Paris I noticed a old-time chocolate brand called \"Poulain\", which is Amelie's family name.

It stars Richard Gere, which immediately raises most peoples suspicions about this being a good horror film, and maybe rightly so.  But it's not the acting that carries the film so much as the creepy storyline and setting that establishes a mood of mystery and danger.Although based on events in the 1960s, the time line in the film is modern and focuses on John Klein (Gere), a successful reporter with a beautiful wife and a rather ordinary life.  The action begins pretty quickly--there is an automobile accident and the wife is found to be harboring a tumor which is terminal.  But before she dies, she draws a number of vicious, moth-like creatures in her notepad.We jump ahead a year or two, and while driving alone at night, Klein's car dies and he suddenly becomes embroiled in a local nightmare of paranormal activities in the town of Point Pleasant hundreds of miles from his intended destination.  One question leads to another, and soon the journalist in Klein is knee-deep in a bizarre story of night-time visitors, unearthly phone calls, and distortions of time and space.  The eyewitness evidence points to a moth-like creature similar to that which his wife drew prior to her death and Klein begins to suspect his excursion to Point Pleasant may not be accidental, but rather planned by some unseen force.The fact is, we are never really sure just what the Mothman is.  In the material plane, we don't even know what the Mothman is.  It doesn't have a physical body (that we ever see), and there are implications it might be electrical or extra-terrestrial.  Nor are we sure about it's mission.  At one point Klein speculates its purpose, but we never really know.  This air of mystery keeps the mood bleak throughout the film, and whenever it seems the Mothman's intentions are good, something will happen that starts our thinking otherwise.  It's a maddening puzzle that spins you in circles, and I think it's why a lot of people don't like the film.  For those who like closure, you won't find any here, but I think that's what the director was going for.  Emphasizing the unknown is an effective tool to produce a frightening landscape.The location and season the film was shot in contributes greatly to this mysterious feeling.  Shooting the film in winter gives it that washed-out look familiar to that time of year, and the cold temperatures mirror the mood perfectly.  The isolated, rural town surrounded by mountains and dotted with industrial symbols (the steel bridge and chemical plant) further lend a sense of chilliness and distance.  The idea that this place is being visited by this inexplicable force renders a feeling of doom and imprisonment, as if this little town so cut off from the light of day is being haunted by a power so great that there is no escaping it.Parts of the movie are a bit hard to follow.  The scene when Klein visits with an expert on the Mothman phenomena is inaudible at times, and the repetitiveness gets stale for a while till the movie moves on to it's final conclusion, but I thought the feel of the movie was scary.  There are a lot of shocking scenes that make you jump, and watching this alone at night can definitely give you the chills.  I guess the idea of a creature like the Mothman with powers of foresight, telepathy, whatever it is, is unnerving.Bottom line here is that the movie keeps your interest and most successfully of all, it draws you into the story.  The characters are engaging, and while we never see a conclusive explanation for the mysterious happenings, this only adds to the appeal of the film.  The ending is also one of the most fantastic I have ever seen and ends the entire saga with a bang.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the guess?", "id": "f99959467e326fbbb252661345fdc373", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000069HYD", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Although I knew from the open, that this was an exercise in the absurd, Cameron Diaz gyrating down the street like a deranged valley girl juxtaposed into the hilly streets of San Francisco?

I suppose we should believe it when we find out she IS one here, solely on the basis of her attire.  These two are best friends, and if that's not hard enough to swallow, add Jane, the third and most unwelcome wheel in this car-wreck trio.  It seems that Jane, played by Selma Blair in an eerily revisited naive, loose bimbo bent as in \"Cruel Intentions\", (see my review)is not happy unless she is being used, abused and laughed at by everyone in town, literally.  Does anyone really think this is a girl bonding film?  A girl BONDAGE film would be less humiliating to women compared to her role here.The ONLY good thing in this film, and the only character I cared about is Peter. (Thomas Jane) Peter is about to get married when he meets Christina, gyrating for a change, at a bar.  There is something electric for both, and Christina, a FEMALE commitment-phobic, feels he may be the one.  Since she can't forget him, she drags Courtney on the worlds most rediculous roadtrip to find him.  If two girls using a filthy public mens room, to wash off a container of spilled festering maggots sounds good, followed by hovering over a urinal for it's intended use...but not in any position normally used by a human, which subsequently causes a geyser to erupt from it, look no further for a quality viewing experience.\"The Sweetest Thing\" tries so hard to be funny, it misses the mark more often than not.  As a woman, I can't see this being a female empowerment film.  Just because Christina is commitment-phobic, a classic man problem revisited in every venue, she doesn't get any upper hand here.  She is not a sympathetic character, and even when getting what she wants, she nearly blows it anyway.Speaking of blowing it, the trio's aforementioned Jane, played by Selma Blair has to be in one of the most humiliating roles a female has ever played.  Picture a life, where the removal of protein stains oddly positioned on clothing lead to embarrassment at the cleaners.  How about a large object lodged behind her tonsils with a human still attached, and needing to sing classic Aerosmith to dislodge it, along with a viewing audience in chorus.  Let's not forget, the conjugal visit to her workplace storage room, from a boyfriend in a big fluffy animal suit that bops her on the head repeatedly while physically engaged.  Is that what the real life of the strong modern woman is supposedly like?  I just want to let the guys know that are asking, the answer is NO.While \"The Sweetest Thing\" has a few good moments, mostly the romance between Diaz's Christina, and Jane's Peter, there are too many over the top, debasing moments to lift the film from wallowing in an abundance of trite silliness.

This probably contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the film, because the screenwriters largely mangled the plot from both of those books, combining them into one movie. If I had looked forward to the actual QotD plotline, I would've been disappointed.Akasha actually has a relatively small role in the film, and Mekare is entirely absent. Maharet is alive and well in the Mojave Desert. Still, it all comes together, and focuses primarily upon Lestat, his transformation into a vampire, and his career as a rock star (his singing voice is Jonathan Davis, the lead singer from Korn, who is perfect for Lestat.)For those unfamiliar with Rice's books, Lestat is a bad boy, even by vampire standards; he likes to cause trouble, and lots of it. We learn why he has a hard time being a vampire, and what he yearns for most of all. In the first few moments of the film, he awakens from a 100-year nap to find an entirely different world - a world in which he can cope much better. He outs himself as a vampire to the whole world, becomes the biggest rock legend around, and begins giving away the secrets of the vampires living among humans. The other vampires are, needless to say, a bit peeved about this, and they come after him. There are several driving forces in the film - Lestat himself, the covens coming after him, Akasha's awakening and subsequent quest for a lover, and Marius, who in this film is Lestat's sire.While the last 20 minutes are somewhat less than gratifying, the rest of the movie is fairly sound and enjoyable. It felt shorter than it actually was, strangely enough. Large sections of the original plot are left out entirely or are incorrectly depicted, and if one were to focus on that point alone, one would probably not enjoy this movie at all. I went into it with the sole intent of just enjoying a movie that looked like it was very beautiful - and it was.Aesthetically, this film is top-notch. The costumes, make-up and special effects are wondefully done. The acting is very good, and the screenplay itself isn't bad, either. Aaliyah did a fine job as Akasha, and Stuart Townsend was a great Lestat - much, much better than Tom Cruise. The settings are appropriately dark and moody, filled with beautiful sets, sensual people, and a wonderful soundtrack, and there is an almost dreamlike quality to much of the film.The one problem I had with the film was that too much was cut out of it for a lot of details and characters to make a great deal of sense. When many of the ancients arrive on the scene, many questions hung in the air, chiefly &quot;ok, who *are* you guys, and why are you helping this person?!&quot; The DVD features many scenes that were cut, though, and includes notes on why the filmmakers removed them. Many of them help things come into focus more clearly, and it's unfortunate that they were deleted. Perhaps someday, an extended version will be released, reintegrating these scenes.Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie experience, and I think even Anne Rice fans will enjoy it, if they can look beyond the liberties taken with the storyline, and just try to enjoy a vampire movie that's better than most.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the soundtrack?", "id": "3af777beb2bec67fc375f2d0e5a3f910", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Boy we are very critical of this film aren't we?Since when has Hollywood ever followed the plot in a book?

I liked all the actors; they were a credit to the roles they played with Stuart Townsend coming across very well as the tormented yet truculent vampire Lestat and David Talbot played by Paul McGann was really good as the man uneasy in the presence of vampires but drawn to them all the same.The Queen of the Damned is play by the late singer Aaliyah and I was surprised at how good she was, I wasn't expecting much but she did the role credit despite what other critics have said and I liked the idea of a Vampire becoming a rock superstar whose links to the Queen of the Damned are through his music and his drinking of her blood, a novel idea in my opinion.Akasha the Queen of the Damned is the mother of all Vampires, she knows no restraint, she will drink the world dry of mortal and immortal blood, she is sensual, she is a demon, she is blood lust all rolled into one violent and burning package and Lestat has awakened her and she wants to turn the world into her own little feast fest but she wants a King at her side and Lestat is going to be that King.Bring into the world of the Vampire and mortals Jesse played by the able actress Marguerite Moreau whose ties to the Vampire world is through an ancestor who before being made had born a child, and had watched over that child's descendents through the ages, add to that other Vampires, cruel, sensual, wicked, avaricious but occasionally compassionate and you have a heady tale of love, lust, desire, music and lashings of blood and pain.Good special effects, and a great sound track, all in all a great little horror flick that works well on the small screen!I quite liked the scene in the film when Jesse offers David immortality, she is now a Vampire herself and Lestat's consort but David hurriedly refuses, he likes his mortal ties.  However the Vampire Marius who made Lestat, played wonderfully by the delicious Vincent Perez has other ideas, Lestat is now with Jesse and Marius has his eye on David.  The film ends with Marius going into the library where David is alone and we know he is going to force David to become a Vampire!

I also love Crispin Glover (Geroge McFly, although in the 2nd one he was played by Jeffrey Weissman) who was so completely funny. Christopher Lloyd as the Doc was perfect.

I also like both of the Jennifers (Claudia Wells was in the first one) (Elisabeth Shue was in the second 2 movies.) My favorite Jennifer was Claudia Wells but she refused to do the sequels because of \"personal issues.\" Maybe she wanted more money like Crispin Glover? Oh and I also really liked Wendie Jo Sperber (may she rest in peace) (who played Marty's sister, Linda.) I especially liked how Linda took the curlers out of her hair at the dining room table, that's so 80's!!Instead of going on about the storylines and plots for each of these movies (that the entire world has seen) I thought it would be more fun to describe some of the old and otherwise archaic technologies, culture and styles that were displayed in the \"future\" Hill Valley of 2015. It made the movie appear somewhat dated, but that's why it's an entertaining 80's film.Payphones - There was a clear shot of one during the daytime scene when Marty left the cafe. I can't remember the last time I've even seen a payphone, let alone used one (maybe 10 years?) Last year the country's biggest phone company announced that because of the advent of cell phones they were getting out of the payphone business.Picture Frames - There was a ton of these all over the McFly's end table. Although not obsolete yet, most agree that within the next few years we will begin to see less and less of these because digital frames will be much easier to access.Bulletin Flyers - These were displayed outside of the cafe, near the dumpster. This is something else that I can't remember seeing for years and years. Probably because of electronic networks like Craigslist.Sales Staff that \"wait on\" customers - The saleslady in the \"antique\" store was totally waiting on Marty and trying to get him to buy something. The small \"mom & pop\" stores of yesterday are nearly totally gone. And those huge department stores that replaced them do not have the time, energy or patience to wait on anyone.Faxes - Marty's home had fax machines everywhere (even inside the closet!) First of all, did you see how antiquated the print on the faxes looked? So 1985. For the home consumers, faxes and telexes are about as useful as Morse code. And for businesses they will be a thing of the past within the next 5 to 10 years for obvious reasons.Mailboxes - There was one in the \"center\" of Hill Valley (next to the USA Today newspaper dispenser.) With electronic billing, text messages and cell phones we are mailing less and less. \"Snail mail\" will never completely evaporate, but these old-fashioned-looking mailboxes are becoming a thing of the past.Green Screen Door - This was the door that old Biff scampered out of before he got in the taxi to follow Doc and Marty. You'd think that in 2015 they would have nicer looking doors? This one looks like something straight out of the 1950's.Oversized Earnings - The saleslady in the \"antique\" store was wearing this godawful pair of yellow earrings that are roughly the size of a Jr. cheeseburger from Wendy's. And the old Jennifer also had on a pair of these large things on her ears. Ear-jewelry like this has not been in style since \"The Golden Girls\" were on TV.Wallpaper - The McFly's home was covered in this. This is something else that is totally out of style. Last year when I was helping a friend redo her kitchen we went to a popular home improvement store to get some border and were told that they stopped manufacturing this years ago....The entire \"Back to the Future Trilogy\" is beyond perfect. And, the music is so fast and funny. Huey Lewis & The News. My goodness, talk about bringing back the dead. The Trilogy is not too much and not too little. You know how some movies can drag on and on and on (like this review?) that's not the case here. Michael J. Fox was a brand-new man in each of these movies. Of course the first one is the very best. But I enjoyed \"Back to the Future Part II\" immensely (and Part III, as wel.) As any child of the 80's can attest to, this movie was such a hugely anticipated event. \"Back to the Future Part II\" was almost like a religious experience because no one could live without it. Everyone has to see all 3 of these movies. Even if the \"Back to the Future Trilogy\" had Skippy, Elyse, Mallory & Tina Yothers it still couldn't be more 80's!

The 80's were so comforting to me.  It was before every movie was filmed with a handheld jerky camera and as much cursing as they could cram in.  Also, it was before the age where everyone had to have a reality show.  The picture quality is very good, but I really can't judge, because I've only watched them on network tv.

After watching it, I bought the entire trilogy and the results are awesome!!!.Back to the Future (1985):BTTF is a great film because it has a lot of elements in the right place. It's funny, the cast is impeccable, the premise is original and smart, is really entertaining and the friendship between Doc and Marty feels genuine giving the movie a heart. Zemeckis accomplished a film that in other hands could've been a complete mess but here, it's completely unerstandable and not hard to follow. BTTF is a truly classic that has stood the test of time and is my favorite of the trilogy. Simply a masterpiece.Back to the Future part II (1989):Sequels, as we know are dangerous propositions that can either expand the story in glourious ways or sink it in the deep bottom of oblivion. Fortunately, BTTF2 is not the case of a bad sequel and indeed it expands the story in interesting ways. The movie has a lot of elements that made the first so good but also it complicates things more and takes the adventure to new levels. We go to the year 2015, an alternate 1985 and we go back again to 1955. The special effects are really good, although some of them seem dated by today's standards. Still, the story is really good and keeps you involved the whole time. The cast as always is impecable and it is also worth noting that this is the darkest film of the three.Back to the Future part III (1990):The third film in a trilogy is usually the worst one. But sometime is always the best (TS3), in this case BTTF3 is not the best of the three but is still really good and concludes the trilogy in a high note. The movie is lighter than the previous one and a little bit more entertaining too. The western setting is spectatucar and surprinsingly it works really well. The characters of Marty and Doc Brown end as full rounded characters and in the case of Doc Brown we see him in a completely new perspective. This movie is full of humor, romance and great action sequences. It is really high quality entertainment.Video & AudioAll three BTTF films were given full restorations with impressive results. The image in all three is clear, crisp, full of contrast and detail. Skin tones are mostly natural and grain is visible though not annoying. Sometimes the image looks a little soft but that's because of the techniques that they used to film them. A faithful and outstanding tranfer for all of them. Thank you Universal.In the audio department, all three films feature 5.1 DTS-HD MA and the results are great. Dialogue is crystal clear, the music sounds clear and there is no sign of hissing or other annomalies. A great audio presentation.Bonus Features:This package is full of bonus material spread across the three discs. The most note-worthy is a six part new documentary newly created for this set that are called \"Tales from the Future\" spread across the three movies. In the first movie you have \"In the Beginning...\", \"Time to Go\" and \"Keeping Time\". In the second movie you have \"Time Flies\" and in the third you have \"Third Time's the Charm\" and \"The Test of Time\". This six-part documentary is incredible as all the people involved in the making of the films discuss everything that was done with the trilogy. It's a piece that should not be missed. Alsoyou have archival documentaries from previous releases, audiocomentaries, galleries, trailers, The Back to the Future Night with Leslie Nielsen  and The Back to the Future Ride (both are great), deleted scenes, The Phiysics of Back to the Future and much more.You also have Digital Copies of the three films.My set also came with a Hot Wheels DeLorean replica.Closing Thoughts:The BTTF trilogy is one of the best that have been released and regardless which one is your favorite (mine's the first), the three of them offer high quality entertainment. With great restorations and a good amount of bonus material including a spectacular new documentary, Universal have made this set a must-own for everyone.

It plays not so much on going back in time to save the world, but yourself. It plays on all the things we wonder about time-travel but are never seen in any movies but these. Now to start off with, my liking for them goes in order; the first is my favorite, second is my second favorite, and third is my least favorite. The first film has a unique magic to it, and is capable of surviving the playback test. I could watch it a hundred times and not get sick of it. It's charm keeps bringing you back for more. However, I feel that the other two, mostly the third one, just drag on. The second one is helpful to answer your questions from the first, but the third is almost nonsense.

The widescreen version originally had a problem with the last two movies, and I wouldn't get that until I knew for sure it was fixed.  Besides, since these are movies kids will appreciate most, the full screen versions tend to be what kids like (even though I always prefer widescreen).What I discovered is that my younger children did not know these movies.  I wondered if there being twenty years old would keep them from enjoying them.  I shouldn't have worried.  They enjoyed them immensely.  There were some cultural references that they did not get until I explained them (more from the 50s than the 80s), but that helped them gain some perspective on how culture changes over time.Unlike \"The Lord of the Rings\", this was never meant to be series of movies.  However, the huge global success of the first film led to the other two.  One evidence that a sequel was never planned is discussed in one of the extras.  It was pointed out that if they were setting up a sequel in the last scene of the first film, they would not have brought Marty's girlfriend in the car.  Having her there created tremendous problems in the second film, as you know if you have seen that film.The first film was inspired by the notion of a teenager discovering that his parents were once his age.  The time travel is the means to make that discover happen.  While the danger of changing the future is always there, it doesn't always have to be for the worse.  It sets up some very interesting notions about time travel, but it isn't really a movie about that or special effects.  It is about growing up in whatever time one lives and finding a deeper connection with one's parents and their lives.The second film begins in the future (building on the ending of the first film).  Because of something Marty was thinking about doing there and Biff acts on, the whole of history is changed again, and this time for the worse.  Doc Brown and Marty have to go back and prevent that change from occurring.  This leads to some very complex plotting because we have Marty's parents living their lives, Marty from the first film doing his thing, and now Marty from the second film coming back there to try and undo what Biff from the future has set in motion.  We learn from the extras about how hard these shots were to accomplish using the new Vistaglide from ILM.  Nowadays, it would be easy in digital, but unavailable in 1988.The third film was shot while the second film was in editing.  Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is the romantic lead in this film!  It is set in the old west.  At the end of the second film the flying time machine is struck by lightening and disappears.  Moments afterward a car drives up from Western Union delivering a letter they had on file for seventy years.  Brown explains to Marty that he is happy in the past and to not come for him, but tells him how he can get home to his time in 1985.  But Marty learns that Brown was murdered shortly after the letter was written and is determined to go back and get him.The problem is how to get from 1885 to 1995 without any gasoline to get the car up to 88 mph and how to get there before Doc is killed.  Do they make it?The extras are interesting and useful in understanding the making of the films.  There is commentary that you can listen to for all three films as well as short documentaries, some deleted scenes, and a few outtakes.Buying the movies as a trilogy this way is quite affordable and the extras make it an even better buy.Recommended!  However, beware that in the mid 1980s that most of the successful teen films were \"R\" rated, so the studios made sure there was some swearing (mostly the SH-word) to make it a bit more \"mature\".  It kind of sounds out of place today - which would likely have WORSE language.  These films are rated \"PG\" and that seems right.", "qas": [{"question": "How interesting was the commentary in the movie?", "id": "6f8fe338ab4d724c7e6d0237ff2a36ba", "answers": [{"text": "interesting and useful in understanding the making of the films", "answer_start": 3233}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00006C7G9", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I don't think anyone can say enough about this series of shows.

What can you say about the whole \"showdown\" between Shaggy and Scooby with bodily function noises? I was in stitches in the theatre. It had me laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes!If you're looking for an in-depth storyline, forget it. It's not there. This movie is playing homage to the old cartoons that I grew up watching UNTIL Scrappy came on board. And yet, they even play homage to that in a way I love. For all the Scrappy haters out there, we get our just revenge with what happens in this movie to him. Many people let this cloud their judgment of the movie and hate it just because of that. Well, I see that the makers of this movie agree with the rest of us: SCRAPPY STUNK! He was obnoxious, selfish and just overall irritating! He never should have existed and that his appearance was the downfall of the Scooby series.Each character is VERY believable, especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. And, with me being a Buffy fan, I just HAD to see SMG in this movie as Daphne. She pulled it off great. As for Freddy Prinze Jr., I'm not so sure he was the BEST Fred, but he pulled it off for me, even though his Fred was different from the cartoon in many respects.As for the DVD, the widescreen edition looks awesome. The features on the DVD are pretty good for a WB release. My kids loved listening to the commentary from the stars. The other features of the movie are pretty good as well and the DVD-ROM features are pretty cool. My 6-year-old daughter loved the games from the DVD-ROM.The deleted scenes are pretty cool. Some, you wonder why they removed them, but if you listen to the commentary while watching them, you can understand why that was done and it makes total sense.Now, supposedly this movie had a lot of sexual and drug references in them that were ultimately removed. I was one of the people who wanted those to be removed when I read about it in a newspaper article before the movie was released and I'm glad those aren't included here. Many people would probably cry foul that they were not included, but since my daughters know how to navigate around the DVD features, I would NOT want them to have access to them. Plus, I do not want to have to lock this DVD out with parental locks. Instead, I would want my daughters to be able to watch this when they want. So, kudos to WB for not including those scenes and for not releasing them at all in the theatres. Otherwise, I would have refused to take my daughters to it and they already knew it was coming, so that would have been a total blow to them.Excellent movie, excellent DVD. I still watch this movie and get a laugh. The soundtrack is pretty good as well. I can't get into a lot of the rap and hiphop stuff, but some of it on the soundtrack is pretty good. I would recommend getting that as well. My daughters absolutely love the soundtrack and dance to it until they drop with exhaustion.I would be prepared that it's PG for a reason: lewd humor (the bodily noises section) and Fred DOES utter a derogatory word about women that you hear alot from today's generation, but it actually was something I didn't catch until someone else said something about it. Since he talks in the \"lingo\" after being possessed, it's kind of hard to understand and I think for most kids, it will go over their heads. Also, Daphne talks about opening up a can of whoop, uh, mule on someone. It's too bad they couldn't have left those out.Overall, an excellent movie. Fun and funny to watch over and over again.

The book \"Joshua\", written by Father Girzone, a retired Catholic priest, is a book designed to move across religious borderlines and into the heart of all people.  Girzone uses the character Joshua to be his mouthpiece for both his appreciation and criticisms of organized religions and specifically the Catholic Church.  Girzone makes some stinging criticisms of the Church and organized religion which are no doubt true in many ways.  And he should know! However, Girzone attempts with words what the movie displays with such grace that no words can describe.Now about the Joshua movie, the movie has a more positive and uplifting message to it because it focuses on love and grace of God and reaches into the hearts of men.  In the movie, Joshua, a drifter who visits the small community of Auburn, brings the town together by demonstrating his fellowship with all people and his helpfulness in every corner as he uses his skills as a wood carver and his gift as healer to open the eyes and hearts of the community to the unconditional love and eternal message of God.  His message is simple and beautiful with every action.  He transcends the dogmatic ideologies and stigmas that accompany the narrowly minded religious individuals in the movie, only to tople their ignorance with his love.

After running around the corridors for a bit the two end up on the sanitarium roof where due to clever planning Michael is flipped off the building and ends up hanging onto the edge of the roof. During this he dropped his large knife which is picked up by Laurie. As she walks over she mutters \"I'm not afraid of you anymore. I hope you're not afraid of me.\" Stupidly she reaches down to recover his mask (just to make sure it's Michael and she doesn't kill another innocent guy) but Michael manages to grab her and pull her down so they're both hanging off the roof. He regains his trusty knife and stabs Laurie in the back then drops her. He looks while his sister and famous victim for Halloween 1,2 & H20 plummits to the ground. That is the bit I hated. Jamie Lee Curtis is the star of Halloween and whenever someone says Halloween you'll always associate it with Jamie Lee Curtis. So they re-introduce her character in the excellent Halloween H20 only to kill her off in the next sequel!!!

Soon though Michael gets his hands on Sara but she escapes leaving Michael in a fiery ending. But as we all know . . . EVIL NEVER DIES!!! The thing I didn't like in this film was the lack of time. Due to such a short space you found people getting killed every ten minutes like in Scream 3. Also the acting can get so cheesy at time you wonder if the film should have gone straight to video.

In the wake of previous events, another Slayer has been activated and come to Sunnydale: Faith, who is altogether mad, bad, and dangerous to know. In due course, Faith grows from Buffy's adversarial colleague to her friend, and finally to jealous betrayer, selling Buffy and everyone she knows out to their worst enemy, Richard Wilkins III, demon Mayor of Sunnydale.Though everything about this season is superior, its true highlight is the best pair of villains the series ever produced: Faith and the Mayor, played beautifully - and with an oddly touching personal chemistry - by Eliza Dushku and Harry Groener.

A the time, almost 4 months into 2003, Brock Lesnar won the Royal Rumble, Kurt Angle & HHH were champions, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, and Steve Austin (among others) were set to return, Shawn Michaels making his return to Wrestlemania,  Goldberg was going to make his long awaited WWE debut. All things considered, this had the makings to be a blockbuster show.Here's my review:March 30, 2003; Safeco Field; Seattle, WA1. WWE Cruiserweight champion Matt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio, (A criminally short match between these two. If given more time, this could've been classic, but it's an above average match to say the least.)**1/22. The Undertaker vs. The Big Show & A-Train in a handicap match,(Originally, Nathan Jones was going to team with the Undertaker, but he was \"taken out of action\" during the Heat episode before this show. Undertaker defeated Show and A-Train in this match. Not that watchable.)*3. WWE Women's champion Victoria vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz in a triple threat match, (Another fairly average match for the women's division.)**4. WWE tag team champions Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. Chris Benoit & Rhyno vs. Eddie & Chavo Guerrero in a triple threat match, (Not a bad match @ all. These teams could've had a much better match, but with the next set of matches, we could see that more time was given to the main matches.)**1/25. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho, (HBK made his grand return to Wrestlemania in this classic match. I enjoy this one every time I watch it.)****1/46. World champion Triple H vs. Booker T, (Myself and others thought that Booker T was going to leave as champion, but HHH ended up winning in the end. Not a bad match per se, barely good, but not great.)**1/27. Hulk Hogan vs. Vince McMahon in a street fight, (Wow, when you have TWO legendary senior citizens competing, can you have a decent match? In the case of these two, you can. Even though it was overbooked, it still was a decent match considering the people involved.)**1/28. The Rock vs. Steve Austin  (After viewing this match on many occasions, it deserves four stars. Both men truly worked in this one, with Rock FINALLY defeating Austin @ Wrestlemania. Not better than the Wrestlemania X-Seven match, but 50% better than the Wrestlemania XV match.)****9. WWE champion Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar, (Two decorated athletes putting on a wrestling clinic in the main event. Everyone knew this was going to be Angle's last match for a while because he had to have neck surgery, other than that, this was a fantastic match.)****1/4Extra Features as wellAlternate Spanish CommentaryWrestlemania 3rd DegreeThe Road to Wrestlemania:Wrestlemania Press Conference in Seatle (September 24, 2002)Edge's Wrestlemania Media TourWrestlamania Press Conference in New York CityWrestlemania Weekend:Trish Stratus - Full AxxessWorld Tag Team Championship from Sunday Night Hear before Wrestlemania: Chief Morley & Lance Storm vs. Rob Van Dam & Kane (*1/2)From Sunday Night Heat: Attack on Nathan JonesPost-Match Commnets: Victoria, Rey Mysterio, A-Train, Nathan Jones, Stacy Keibler & Torrie WilsonWrestlemania Retro - Superstars reveal their favorita 'Mania moment: Christian, D-Von Dudley, Rob Van Dam, Shawn Michaels, Big Show, Spikey Dudley, Bubba Ray Dudley, Diamond Dallas Page, Trish Stratus and Steve AustinWrestlemania Feature:Wrestlemania 1: The BeginningWrestlemania Celebrity Celebrity MomentsHulk Hogan vs. Andre the GiantHulk Hogan at WrestlemaniaUndertaker UndefeatedComments on Hogan vs. McMahon - 20 Years in the Making: Gene Okerland and Bobby HeenanWrestlemania Promotional Spots: Wrestlemania Image Spot, Wrestlemania - 4 Main EventsThe Catfight Girls: Lunch, The Pool, The Rock vs. AustinMr. McMahon Training Vignettes: At Trax Training Center, In the Weight RoomThe Night after Wrestlemania XIX: Goldberg Debuts on Raw (March 31, 2003)Easter EggGo to the \"Chapters\" section on disc 2 and highlight \"The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin\" match and press the right arrow on your remote control.

Taker picks up the win to keep a perfect record at Wrestlemania. (7/10)Trish Stratus vs. Victoria vs. Jazz for the Women's Title.

This was very faced paced action and it had some great moves and this match was overall pretty good.  Team Angle retain the belts.

(9.5/10)Triple H vs. Booker T for the World Title.  This was nothing near Eddie vs. Kurt at Wrestlemania XX.  The reason I say this is because Eddie vs. Kurt was decided by a superstar who didn't win the Rumble.  Anyways, this was a good match and Triple H retained his belt. (8/10)Hulk Hogan vs. Mr. McMahon in a Street Fight.  This match was very bloody and the buid-up was incredible and these 2 do things I never imagine they could do.  Hogan wins then gets fired on Smackdown!  (9/10)The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin was a good match because Austin had way to much on his shoulders to put on a classic match.  The Rock picks up the win and Austin hangs it up. (8/10)Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar for the WWE Title.  This was a good match but it lacked in certain areas.

It had some new ideas and concepts and some of them didn't really work in the right ways for me. But it did have some brilliant episodes, and got us more interested about the military involvement in vampire slaying.WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!Here's my episode-by-episode guide to Season 4#1 THE FRESHMAN - 4/5. A very good opener. Lots of comedic scenes and also shows the estrangement of your first few days of college nicely.#2 LIVING CONDITIONS - 3.5/5. Funny funny episode! I wasn't really all that happy with how it turned out, but it keeps the laughs coming on in, and the editing techniques were great.#3 THE HARSH LIGHT OF DAY - 4/5. This episode gets better with repeated viewings. Lots of good insights on relationships and such. Good music too, and seeing Spike in the sunlight was a treat.#4 FEAR, ITSELF - 4/5. Genuinely creepy episode with great production design. Also some good foreshadowing for the rest of the show.#5 BEER BAD - 2/5. Stupid, pointless episode. But I did kind of enjoy it's silly qualities. Quite funny in parts but overall - just lame and unneeded.#6 WILD AT HEART - 4.5/5. The girl who plays Veruca was atrocious and brought this episode down from a 5. Everything else was excellent!#7 THE INITIATIVE- 4/5. We finally learn about those damn commando guys! A good episode with many funny scenes that got the story-arc going.#8 PANGS - 2.5/5. Gets worse everytime I watch it. The story isn't really needed to the arc of the season, and seems just pointless...#9 SOMETHING BLUE - 4/5. Awesome comedic episode, with great performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Marsters.#10 HUSH - 5/5. Brilliant episode of BTVS - one of the best ever if you ask me! Joss did a brilliant directing and writing job. A unique, very frigtening, funny and just excellent and enjoyable hour of TV!#11 DOOMED - 4/5. Keeps getting better with every viewing. Written by Marti Noxon, Jane Espenson and David Fury - this mixes all of their talents together - drama, comedy and action. Good episode, if not perfect.#12 A NEW MAN - 4/5. Very almost a 4.5, maybe after more viewings. This episode was hilarious and finally Giles got his own little story arc. It didn't really move the story-arc along or anything, but fun all the same.#13 THE I IN TEAM - 4/5. In which we are introduced to the big bad for season 4, and a questionable big bad he is...but the rest of this episode was 4.5 material!#14 GOODBYE IOWA - 3.5/5. Didn't hold my interest as much as the previous episode, but this one definitely gets the big bad's story-arc on the road as we learn more about him. Marc Blucas' acting is also brilliant here.#15 THIS YEAR'S GIRL - 4.5/5. Praise FAITH! She is just an amazing character and I can't explain how great it was to have her back. Everything about this episode was enjoyable - one of the best of the season!#16 WHO ARE YOU - 5/5. Just when I thought it couldn't get better than This Year's Girl, they give us a true Jossian episode with Who Are You. It's a weird idea that could've gone awry, but instead it turns out to be a brilliant one that furthers our knowledge of the characteristics of both Faith and Buffy. Funny, dramatic - brilliant!#17 SUPERSTAR - 4/5. Groovy little episode that gets better every time I watch it. Danny Strong did a great job and the alteration to the credits is just classic in the best sense of the word. Great job!#18 WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE - 0.5/5. Even worse than Superstar. This episode gives a good reason for people to say why they don't like BTVS. This is probably the worst episode of the show ever.#19 NEW MOON RISING - 4.5/5. Thank God for Oz! After those two HORRIBLE episodes beforehand, on comes Oz for his final episode of BTVS (I think, you never know with Joss). The acting here is great, and there is a lot of brilliantly written drama by Marti Noxon.#20 THE YOKO FACTOR - 4.5/5. Good good good! A funny episode that prepares us for the showdown with Adam and the Initiative. Very well done and with great acting by Marc Blucas and David Boreanaz.#21 PRIMEVAL - 4/5. Lots and lots of great action sequences here, and it was awesome to see the gang working as a team once more. The fight with Adam is just classic!#22 RESTLESS - 5/5. One of the most amazing episodes of the show. Though it doesn't quite beat out Hush for best episode of the season. It is very close though. There is a lot of character development here, and the directing job is probably the best the show will ever have. A great way to finish S4!--- DVD REVIEW ---This DVD is great and gives you deeper insight into the ideas for the season. The writers and directors give you a lot of good insights into the episodes they wrote. I love this DVD package.

As such, I've been able to see so much more than having to have waited for a year to enjoy them all.  This show has had so many little things that added up from previous seasons.  The characters have grown and changed, the cast has grown with it.  The stories have gotten better, and more interesting.  All of which led to the last episode...the begining of the dominion war.  I was thrilled.  Sisko has come into his own as captain.  All the characters are now more and more interesting.  The supporting characters are great, and frankly this show is one of the best science fiction shows around.  I regret treating this show like the middle child it seemed to be.  Left after the next generation, but not allowed to become the flagship show  (that was left to voyager), constantly having to fight off other sci-fi competitors (babylon 5), this show was always given the raw end of the stick.  But the show didn't seem to care.  Every season has improved, and rather than copy what others had done, this show stayed the course it always intended.  Having watched this show from the begining, you can tell the intent for the dominion war from as soon as season 2.  This show could have played off old star trek cliche's, but instead chose to be its own, for better or worse.  Try this show.

The pursuit begins with an encounter in the South Atlantic in which the smaller Surprise comes off second best but survives.  Aubrey decides to repair his ship at sea and pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and into the South Pacific.  The ship and crew will enjoy a brief visit to the stunning Galapagos before returning to the hunt.  The climax of the movie is the second confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron.Russell Crowe is pitch-perfect as Jack Aubrey, firm but fair master and commander.  Paul Bettany is equally perfect as the ship's doctor and the commander's best friend, who will try to mitigate the effects on the crew of Aubrey's obcessive pursuit of the Acheron halfway around the world.The movie is rich in period detail and provides a fascinating glimpse into life aboard a British warship, crewed by tough sailors and officered by a interesting collection of sometimes desperately young officers.

I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship \"Acheron\", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.The captain of the \"Acheron\" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004", "qas": [{"question": "Is the movie easy to understand?", "id": "de5db4b613298c76b8612b5891ec75a8", "answers": [{"text": "you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie", "answer_start": 1879}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00008YGRU", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I must admit that I did not expect the second season of 24 to be as exciting and thrilling as the first, and I had my doubts especially since it was using the same formula of real time events unfolding over the course of one day,and hence the originality factor that made the first season such a success is not there.Moreover, many friends have advised me that indeed Jack Bauer's second adventure was weaker.Yet two things I have learned after years of a passionate appreciation of cinema and good TV:Never let other opinions or reviews influence your own judgment, andNot being quite original does not mean a bad thing a all, if the writing, acting and direction are good enough to pull it off.So, watching the second season of 24, I was totally captivated from the very first hour till the very last..Indeed I found the second series of 24 to be far better in many ways, and this is why..First of all the familiarity with most of the characters ensured that the viewer sympathizes/connects with them from the very start, as opposed to taking maybe few 'hours' to be totally involved as with the original.Secondly, the writing was superb:While the first, despite the nail biting tension, twists and suspense, had a very simple and straightforward plot, an eye for an eye personal revenge, the second expands the possibilities much more, and delves into very dark and dangerous grounds, both on a international terrorism and domestic conspiracies levels. The writing is so good in fact that you will be excused in believing even for mere seconds, that you are watching more than the entertaining fiction that it really is.All actors involved are excellent, but I am surprised no one has mentioned one particular actor who was instrumental in lifting this second series up, and infusing a lot of humanity albeit tragic, and that is Xander Berkeley.He, in my opinion, gives the performance of his career , as does Berkeley's real life missus the lovely Sarah Clarke, who makes a comeback, and is chillingly transformed into this cold blooded assassin and traitor that we only saw few glimpses of in the closing minutes of the first season.Dennis Haysbert aka David Palmer now president,is not only a very able actor who added a lot of dignity and class to his role, but I must admit he makes one helluva president too!!!The twists and suspense in the second season never lapse for one second, up until the very last minute, which leaves the door open for lots of possibilities for the third season.I liked the fact that the plot in the second season was evenly divided into two sections, connected smoothly over these crucial 24 hours.. The hunt, against the clock for the nuke and the conspiracy inside Washington, and the shadowy men behind it all.Of course, the second series has its minor flaws: the sub plots involving the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert were somehow weak in comparison to everything that was going on ..(a psycho abusive father, the loner nut case in the woods, the over the top deranged Latino father-to-be in the store..).All credit should go to all people involved in this wonderful series for the collective effort that has been put to produce quality television that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen, for 24 hours and more!

It is, sad, though, to see so many chances missed in a single film.Stonewall Jackson (the overriding subject of this film) is probably the most interesting American Military leader in our nation's history and deserves a film at least of the caliber of Patton; yet in this film so little is really revealed about him, other than that he is devoutly religious, loves his wife, enjoys the company of children and wins a lot of battles. More focus, better casting, and less attempted breadth of scope would have produced a more biographical film to be much more valued and enduring. The strangest irony of all is that the perfect actor to portray Jackson in such a biograpy was already in the film, cast as Lee. (The fact that Duval was so disappointing as Lee only adds to this irony.)The greatest disappointment, however, was the portrayal of the battle of Chancellorsville, which was so hurried that it only occupied about 20 minutes of film time. Chancellorsville was in fact the most significant, greatest and longest day of Jackson's life (probably also the greatest single day for the confederacy) perfect for him in every way, including, perhaps, the fact that it also happened to be his last day in charge of his army. Such an end for him, mortally wounded by his own soldiers at the close of his greatest victory, seems almost too perfect not to be scripted. So many wonderful details about this battle were missed, such as the fact that the union soldiers, who were cooking breakfast, were first surprised by deer and other animals bounding from the forest in the path of so many confederates moving rapidly toward them through the woods. To a film which paid so much attention to historical detail, this sort of detail would have added much to the proper mood and the almost mystical qualities of the battle.The worst thing about this film, however, besides the cameo appearance by Ted, which was certainly the low point, was the really sappy music, which intruded frequently on dialog, unnecessarily distracting and annoying any earnest viewer who might still be trying to concentrate on the actors.The film is not entirely bad, however, and does provide at least a cursory view of the early stages of the civil war, and does provide well intended attention to historical detail, setting and costume.", "qas": [{"question": "How do you like the movie?", "id": "a5b34e12b6a497c73982d9aeed43a700", "answers": [{"text": "It's kind of hard to put down a movie like this because", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "It's kind of hard to put down a movie like this because it is such a sincere effort, and because the historical events depicted are so rarely treated in film for contemporary audiences and are so intrinsically intersting", "answer_start": 0}]}]}]}, {"title": "B00009QG5O", "paragraphs": [{"context": "5/13/14 UPDATEIt doesn't appear Lionsgate has pressed corrected blurays yet.

Hopefully, if they received enough calls they will consider a replacement program for this disc.That being said, I would not let this deter you from purchasing this wonderful set.

All of the episodes run 48-49 minutes long (except for the Pilot movie and 'The Lord is My Shepherd' which are double length)and appear to be uncut. Some viewers have mentioned small cuts from a couple episodes. I think the missing snippets may have been added when the show went into syndication and were not part of the original airing. Just my theory. If anyone out there remembers watching this when it first aired, chime in with your feedback.The audio (English, Spanish, and French 2.0) is also an improvement. By no means would I use this to demonstrate my new sound system but the audio is clear and the pitch of the actors' voices are correct as the episodes are no longer sped up as in the previous dvd set.I highly recommend this set and looking forward to Season 2.

Fox television's decision to give the show the worst 'Real Estate' in prime time (Fridays at 8 PM), it's pre-empting by other shows and sports events, not playing the episodes in order and their refusal to promote the show beyond a few commercials surely contributed to it's low ratings.  It was hard to find and confusing to watch.  Never the less, critics praised it, and anyone who watches it (at least everyone I know, including my wife, who is not a Sci-Fi fan) loves it.  This show is a Greek Tragedy.  You could easily say this was the Star Trek for the next Millennium, a sci-fi 'western' that mirrored Gene Rodenberry's idea of 'Wagon Train in space'.  Not to say that the creator, Joss Whedon, was inspired by Star Trek, not at all.  Firefly is more liberal, and more relatable to the real world.  What shines is the cast and the writing.  The ingredients and settings are only slightly out of the ordinary, and in the hands of any average TV creator, would end up being bland and boring.  But the characters in Firefly are so well cast and the episodes so well written, that they stand out as real and tangible people who are cast together on this small ship for a purpose.The story takes place 500 years in the future, where a civil war has just ended and Capt Malcolm Reynolds has gathered together an eclectic crew to take on jobs in an old freighter ship called Serenity, Firefly class.  The ship is one of those So-Ugly-But-Cool, Hang-In-There-Old-Girl, She'll-hold-together, Rely-On-In-A-Pinch Flying buckets that everyone is so glad to see come over the horizon, that it's no wonder Whedon considers it the tenth character on the show.  Always low on fuel, its like the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars, it's destined to become a lovable freighter, and not a high tech ship of exploration.  The difference in characters of the human class is staggering.  You have a Two soldiers, the Captain and his second hand man...err woman, Zoe.  Zoe's husband Wash, who is the pilot.  A mercenary, Jayne, which is a great contrast when played by the muscle bound, 6'2\" Adam Baldwin.  A registered companion, Inara.  Kaylee, the spunky young mechanic who loves her ship, but is obviously too young to know better.  A Doctor and his Sister, Simon and River, who are being pursued by the Alliance due to River's extreme mental intelligence.  And to add wisdom, there's Book, a holy man of the time who seems to be searching for himself.  The dynamics of the characters add to instructing personality studies and contrasts.  They find themselves with nothing in common and sometimes, everything in common when they need each other most.  The possibilities of this show are endless and Fox foolishly dropped it without giving it a fair chance.  The DVD contains all episodes including three that never aired.  The sound and picture quality are superb and the bonus features are great.  Everyone should give this show a chance, to see it for more than just the Sci-Fi aspect, more than just the space adventure, but as a study in character interaction as well.  If it gains popularity like the original Star Trek, maybe we'll be lucky and there will be a 'Next Generation' version in twenty years.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the main character a good character?", "id": "614dd333ac7145718d31016ad1fce740", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I had never heard of this series. I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while.The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a \"shepherd\", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other \"permanent\" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers.Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on some border areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting.The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is \"wrong\". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode.Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers.Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation.Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate.Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled.Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent.War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the \"lady\" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned.The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most.Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well. Things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture. This tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with which they deal. In this episode, a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one. River, though, is not without her own methods.", "qas": [{"question": "How did you like the story?", "id": "81abdc2cbaf6358715b0e221f0fcb599", "answers": []}, {"question": "Do you think a movie with good dialogue?", "id": "ab79cc8432d6617f261ccd27ded849d6", "answers": []}, {"question": "What interesting things are the most important in this movie?", "id": "67130f316f44baca9c51ce0dcbc9db4b", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This show was fantastic.

Firefly maybe short, but it surely is sweet. I love the combination of western mixed with science fiction. The characters in this series are very likeable, each different in many ways. The episodes, while some have been done before on other Sci-fi series, are exciting and still fun to watch. And the ship \"Serenity\" herself is quite a ship.The thing that impresses most about this series is how realistic the show seems. It's set 500 years and the future, and instead of phasers like on Trek, they are still using basic guns like we have now. Another thing that is realistic is how the scenes in space are quiet since no sound is in outer space. Overall, this is a great series. I'm a Trekkie and I love this series. I still haven't seen Serenity but after watching this series, it's a given that I have to buy Serenity!!!", "qas": [{"question": "How is the extra?", "id": "cb76010670a676aabc9fd3d6526bb43b", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I'm not a big fan of Whedon's other works.  I didn't like Buffy and I've never seen Angel.  I say that to express that I can't be considered part of his \"cult\" as some reviewers have insisted everyone giving this show a positive review must be.  I'm just a fan of science fiction, and I think Firefly is cool science fiction.I'd like to address a couple of the complaints that have been promienent:True, there are no aliens.  But so what?  Someone dares to consider that we might not have encountered aliens 500 years in the future, and they're not doing sci-fi?  That's silly.  Most current sci-fi has tended to only use aliens because they can't write interesting characters.  'Let's dress someone up to look odd and people won't notice they don't have much going on in character development.'  I'll take an all human cast if it works, and in this case it does.True, it is very western.  So what?  It's the frontier.  Is it hard to believe that humans will still be humans 500 years from now?  You've been watching too much Star Trek if you thinking flying around in space is going to magically change the human race.  And besides, this is a future that is LIVED IN.  It's not septic at all, it's a real place.Finally, consider that virtually every negative review given was by someone who admits that they never watched more than one or two episodes.  How can you possibly judge a show by one ep?  That's like watching a random ten minutes of a movie and trying to review it.  You can't consider yourself a good judge of quality based on such a short amount of exposure.This show was a fine work.  It's not perfect but it's enjoyable.  The writing is usually sharp and the story is very human.  There's not a ton of action but some of us prefer to have development and story over non-stop explosions.Also of note, the creators of BSG clearly watched Firefly.  The \"silent space\" idea as well as the steady cam zoom-ins in BSG are virtually a rip-off from Firefly.

Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair.  How could it go wrong?  A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets.  Why did it only last one season?  Marketing.  FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the \"fair and balanced\" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness.  For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago.  Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap?  Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting \"reality\" television?  From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be \"yes\".  Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, \"why\".  Yet, in all of its power, it was cancelled.Firefly is perfection on a stick.  The twang of the guitar, the stone-face stare of Mal, the goofiness of Jayne (is that a girls name?), the questionable past of Shepard Book, the humor of Wash, the power of Zoe, and the innocence of Kaylee is exactly why I fell in love with this show.  This is honestly, one of the few series that I could go back from the beginning and watch again, loving every moment of it.  Whedon created a masterpiece in my eyes, and a huge opportunity was missed by several major networks to keep this imagination alive.While some will argue that Firefly was full of nothing more than C-rated actors who were \"shallow cut-outs, and whose dialogue never rises above the level of a so-so sitcom\", I thought that they brought so much personality and charisma to a smorgasbord of unoriginal programming. I wanted to know the truth behind River and the darkness behind the good Shepard.  I continually waited for a snappy comeback from Mal, and was excited whenever he showed humility.  Jayne was a big favorite of mine, always questioning authority, yet as loyal as the family dog.  The love between Zoe and Wash brought a new layer of honesty to this sci-fi series.  It wasn't just about paying for the ship, flying through unmapped terrain, or stealing, it was about humanity.  That sense of humanity could be found in the opening episode for this series aptly titled \"Serenity\".  In it, the crew takes upon some passengers with some rather unknown cargo.  Inside one of those crates is a girl that will change their lives forever.  For this series to work successfully, as it did, we needed human characters that bled, felt compassion, and demonstrated connectiveness to each of us.  Mal's ship, Serenity, was a living example of how television could be done creatively and originally.The characters could only be as strong as the words that were handed to them.  Listening to the words that pass through Mal's mouth, the charm of Wash, or even the inconsistent ramblings of River, you could only wonder where Whedon could have gone with all of them.  In each of these characters, Whedon had written secrets.  While, sadly, we may never know what they all were, that is what made you itch for more episodes.  You not only wanted to see the creative \"western\" adventures that Whedon was sending his crew, but you also wanted to learn more about these band of renegades.  They were good, but possibly darkness reigned inside of them.  The character most guilty of this (outside of River) was Shepard Book.  I loved this character.  Whedon drew him with so much passion and conviction, yet with every episode you learned more about this man than imaginable.  He is an excellent example of what this series was like.  He represented the smart words of Whedon, the humanity of his character, and the secrets that each of these shared.  He was a \"priest\", yet he knew more about the Alliance than anyone aboard that ship.  If anyone were to ask me to describe the series in two words, I would simply say, \"Shepard Book\".George Lucas is credited with creating this detailed futuristic world that gives us glimpses of a possible future, or a galaxy far far away, Whedon succeeded in this series by giving us a plausible future in the not-too-distant future of 500 years.  Prostitution in legal, in fact respected in the community, the Chinese and Americans have forged one super power called the Alliance, and our hero is a war veteran, still not shaken by the loss that his side took due to the Alliance control.  While Lucas gives us far-fetched characters and situations, Whedon gives us a imaginative look at our future.  I think that is why this series worked so well for me.  I could imagine this future.  I could see it past the characters.  I wasn't bogged down by dopey looking aliens, but instead a plausible man vs. man situation.  Firefly was simple, yet so complex.I could honestly go on forever about how much I enjoyed this show.  I have never watched a series where I found myself prepared to watch over and over again. Firefly blends a power mixture of comedy, western, and action all together ... and the characters bleed.  Villains die in this series.  How often do you see that?

After watching about half of the episodes I am just blown away by how wonderful this series is.  I am quite sad that there is only one season.  While a part of me cannot understand why it was cancelled, another part understands more clearly.  Mainstream television viewers are not interested in a show of this quality.  It has too many elements that poor imaginations cannot wrap around...and poor imaginations are a plenty in the living rooms of America.  People dressed like cowboys flying around in spaceships?  We all know that, in the future, we will all be wearing tight fitting uniforms issued by the interstellar government.  Everything will be clean and shiny.  There will be a problem and our heroes will solve it using nothing but intellect.  We can't possibly be so base, in the future, as to punch people out in a matter of principle.Firefly is a refreshing, imaginative look at the future.  The characters are complex and flawed.  The spaceship is dirty.  It is gritty and realistic, which makes the characters and the worlds encountered much more believable and accessible.  I would trade just about everything on television these days, especially all of the &#34;un&#34;reality shows for more seasons of Firefly.  It makes me sad that, just when something truly entertaining comes along, it is tossed in the garbage heap in favor of another police drama or reality show about idiots running around a swamp somewhere carrying guns.Well, at least I found this absolute gem of a show and had one fantastic season to watch.

Sometimes that is a good thing; Fox has canceled many a ludicrous and mind-numbingly inane series. However, sometimes they have canceled series with much promise.Never has Fox messed up so badly as when they canceled \"Firefly\". They took a cursory look at the ratings (98th in the Nielsen ratings, with about 4.7 million viewers per episode), and tossed this wonderful series in the trash can. They never even gave it much of a chance, having only aired 11 of the 14 of the finished episodes - and aired them out of order, with the pilot \"Serenity\" being aired later than other episodes. In short, Fox just seemed totally uninterested in supporting this series from the start.I am not a big fan of television anymore; as a matter of fact I canceled my cable service months ago because programming is just so bad these days. However, I do have Netflix, which allows me to stream quality shows I want to see. I had never even heard of the series, but after seeing gushing praise for Firefly on the Pharyngula blog, I dialed it up on Netflix. And oh, boy, did I ever get a treat.I've been a fan of written and visual science fiction for 4 decades, and as such have experienced it from many angles, both good and not-so-good. With Firefly, I saw sci-fi in a way I had never seen it before. I had of course heard of the term \"space western\", and have seen elements of that concept in shows like Star Trek and in movies like Star Wars and Avatar. However, until now I had never seen the \"space western\" theme realized in such a literal way. The juxtaposition between spaceships and horses, and space stations and frontier towns, is a delight to watch. The storylines are sometimes straight out of westerns, such as the train heist in \"The Train Job\". Josh Whedon, however, flawlessly interweaves the two seemingly at-odds thematic elements, and the result is 14 phenomenal episodes (and a great followup theatrical release, \"Serenity\"). There is an equal mix of drama, humor and action in this series, and just when you think you know what direction an episode is going to take, Whedon takes it in a totally different direction. Rarely is television so well-scripted, especially these days.Interesting concept aside, no television show is worth much if the characters are not believable or interesting. Firefly has great character development. All the main characters are (through both scripting and acting) fully fleshed-out human beings who we grow to deeply care about as we progress through the series. You can tell that the actors really cared about their roles, because their performances effortlessly exude the characters as they were conceived by Whedon. Through these portrayals come the series' great strength - a tale of desperate people of disparate backgrounds who find themselves linked in a particular place and time. We see the love and anger, the humor and sadness, and we identify with them. We want to be with them on Serenity, living the lives that they lead.All in all, I think that the Fox network executive who made the decision to dump this series should be hog-tied and deposited on the deck of a ship full of starving, amorous Reavers. Television is almost never this good, and if Firefly had been allowed to run its originally-planned 7 full seasons, I believe it would be referred to by the general TV-viewing public as one of the all-time great series.Even if you're not a fan of sci-fi, get this anyway.

Firefly comes from the mind of Joss Whedon, who is the mastermind behind Marvels &#34;The Avengers&#34;, Dollhouse, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The show features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.  The series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a &#34;Firefly-class&#34; spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity.  Whedon pitched the show as &#34;nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things&#34;.The show explores the lives of a group of people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the outskirts of society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In this future, the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures.

I hate Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and many other sci-fi shows. When my friends spoke highly of the canceled show 'Firefly', I refused to see it. I thought it was a rip-off of the anime 'Outlaw Star' when I saw the commercial with River in the box (Melfina, the android of the anime, also was found curled up in a similar box). But then one friend really made my ears perk up. One of my favorite actresses, Jewel Staite, was one of the nine main characters on the show! I chuckled at that because I first fell in love with her when she played Catalina on 'Space Cases' which Billy Mummy also helped create and Catalina was an engineering genius, much like Kaylee which Jewel plays wonderfully in 'Firefly'.When I bought the boxset, my heart was troubled. What was I thinking?! I hate sci-fi shows! But it was all for Jewel, I reminded myself. Lo-and-behold, 'Firefly' is now my favorite show on Earth! I need more!!! *Twitches* It has enjoyable characters, lots of humor, drama, a little dash of sex and violence plus a plot line that can be followed pretty easily! All the characters are well-played and I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the main character (usually I like one of the minor characters more then the boring hero seen in many different shows) and understood his struggles with himself, his past and his faith. I was also very surprised at how cheery Jewel's character was. She usually plays the stubborn but nice girls who sometimes turn their noses up at the world. I also liked how the writers made us like Kaylee in the first episode right away before she was...well, you have to find out!If you like space drama/action adventures, don't hesitate to buy it.

It is an sf western with a few brave rogue heroes in a spaceship fighting an evil empire (\"the alliance\").  The music and sets are extremely multicultural, and any cussing or expletives are in Chinese, which adds a wonderful flavor to the dialog.  How does such an impossible combination fantasy world work?  I'm not sure exactly, but it does work.  Kudos to Joss Whedon.  Having amazing sets and special effects certainly helps, and the dialog and acting are well done.However, the (English) dialog lacked quite the same humour and depth of literary reference we know and love from Buffy.  I would have appreciated the DVD's more if the DVD subtitles were to translate the Chinese slang rather than just saying \"(speaks in Chinese)\".  And unlike Buffy, where dialog was at a college grade level, Firefly uses a simpler subset of English language, at more of an advanced high school level.Nathan Fillion, who plays Mal, the captain of Firefly did not work for me as a convincing leadership figure.  His natural character is quite different from the part he plays, and to me he never completely seems to get in character.  There always seems to be a detached and ironic mein that does not seem compatible with the leadership role he tries to play.Lastly, there is not much season arc.  Each episode story stands (quite well) alone.  This was fine with me, but if you need a season arc, or you need more than the 14 episodes in this set, you will be disappointed.In summary, despite a few failings, this was a great series which died prematurely.

When it was later canceled I was not surprised. When Firefly was later released on DVD I heard nothing but praise for this show and how great it was. I admit my curiosity was peaked but I still was not ready to give it a try. Then I heard rumblings that there was a movie in the works based on the show. That along with many of my friends telling me to buy this was enough for me to give it shot. I watched this whole boxest over the period of two days. I was shocked at how good this show was. And I was also angry with myself for never giving this show a chance back when it originally aired on television. But then I realized that I wasn't the only one and now there are thousands of us who have just now discovered this great show on DVD. This show is unlike anything I have ever seen on television and it works. Also it was one of the first sci-fi programs I had ever seen that remembered that in space there is no sound. So during the battles in space you hear nothing and I love that. I really enjoyed all of the characters and looked forward to each episode and what would happen to them next. Also after the first few episodes I found myself singing along with the theme song and still do every once and awhile. But all good things must come to an end and I was disappointed when I had finished the set knowing that there would be no more episodes. But as I mentioned, there is a film that will be released later this year and I cannot wait. I think anyone who is on the fence about this show should take a chance, as I did, and buy this set. And if you don't want to buy it, rent it or borrow it from a friend and I am sure you will end up buying a copy of your own before long.

The TV show was cancelled before all of the Season 1 episodes were shown, although they ultimately aired on The Science Channel.The series failed for a number of reasons; the main one being that the episodes were not shown in the correct order, which was a stupid decision because the feature-length opening episode introduces all of the characters.So why do I like it?Firefly is a mix of action, drama, romance, and adventure. Although it's science fiction, the characters often talk like cowboys. Josh Whedon (Buffy, The Avengers) created the series, as well as directing three episodes and being involved as a writer.The characters have real depth, but the development isn't rushed. The origin of the relationships and character traits are explained gradually as the series progresses. Many of the characters are mysterious, and will make you question their true motivations. But, through it all, each character always seems real. You'll meet a married couple, war veterans, a preacher, a doctor, a psychologically damaged girl, a genius engineer, an apparently dumb mercenary, and a high-class prostitute. It's fascinating to see the existing bonds between some of the characters, and the development of new bonds.Episodes often show the crew taking on a task of some kind to earn their living. These assignments are often illegal, but can also become somewhat noble. If you are a fan of Whedon, you'll know that he uses humor regularly, and it's often present in Firefly. It can be pretty campy at times, but the writing is strong and it never comes across as stupid. Jaynestown is probably the funniest episode, and you'll understand why if you watch the episodes in the correct sequence.I would have to say that I like every character, and that's rare for me with a cast of this size. The biggest mystery in the series surrounds River (Summer Glau), who plays the sister of the ship's doctor, Simon (Sean Maher). Their relationship is arguably the strongest within the group, and there's always a sense that River's story drives the entire series.The Blu-ray includes all of the episodes, and the picture quality is good for the most part. Some of the darker images have lower quality, but the series is so good that you won't sit there criticizing the image. The special features include plenty of commentaries, as well as a making of feature, deleted scenes, and other assorted goodies.If you do become hooked on the series, you'll need to watch Serenity (2005), which was a two-hour movie wrapping up the main story. That's a fantastic science fiction movie, but you'll appreciate it more if you know the characters well. Firefly runs for almost 11 hours, and you'll end up wishing for more. The movie gives the show a proper ending, and won't leave you hanging.At the time of writing, it's available on Amazon.com for less than $20.

The writing is original and witty.  The humor is wickedly funny, especially as delivered by the incredibly talented and likable cast.  There are moments for every person and every mood.  This is the only show I have ever watched that can both make me laugh out loud and move me to tears, without being cheesy or overdramatic for a second. Everyone I have shown Firefly to has loved it...young or old, male or female.The show is set 500 years in the future, but this is not the sterile future so often portrayed....it has a very human and realistic feel that makes you think this is really what it might be like down the line.  Technological advances and political changes have taken place, but human society is very much the same.  It takes place partly in outer space and on multiple planets, but there are no aliens.The music on the show is unusual and grounds it as an almost down-to-earth story rather than your typical sci-fi fare. I always fast-forward the title credits and theme song on TV shows, but with Firefly I listen to the song and watch the beautifully done credits every time.There are 9 main characters in the show, and by the time you are halfway through the series they will become your second family.  The cast has such incredible chemistry and the writing is so good that it's impossible not to care about them deeply.Look at it this way; for a TV show that was cancelled in the middle of it's first season to not only be amazon's #3 best seller but to have gotten a major motion picture released based on it, it must be something pretty incredible.

The singers are all at least good, if not uniformly great. The following singers are excellent: Simon Keenlyside (Papageno) with a voice that is expressive, well-managed, and handsome in every way, not to mention that his acting is a thorough delight; Diana Damrau  (Queen of the Night), manic and technically and dramatically brilliant; and Dorothea R&ouml;schmann (Pamina) with creamy tone and perfect technique. This is not a girlish princess, which is to say that the role is often sung with a lighter voice; but I cannot complain about a voice as luxuriant as this. Sometimes Tamino and Pamina are presented as characters just barely out of their teens, which can suit the freshness and innocence implied by their roles; however, this thirtyish-looking couple works fine, too, especially as it allows us to experience fuller voices. R&ouml;schmann probably looks rather young from seats in the theater, but the Blu-ray close-ups aren't very flattering. The Three Ladies are also among the most excellent singers in this performance. Choral work is very good, as would be expected in Britain.This performance falls short of the best in several respects. The first weakness I observed was during the overture, which failed to build much excitement or sense of anticipation for this evening of magic & music. I have never wholly understood why Colin Davis is held in such high regard as a Mozart & Haydn conductor (his reputation as a Berlioz interpreter is better deserved in my opinion). \"Fortune favors the bold\" is a line in the libretto, which should have been heeded by Davis, who fails to ask much of the orchestra and doesn't get any more than asks for. Everything is elegant, safe, and in its place; and only rarely do things sound stodgy; but there is neither fire nor anything else particularly revelatory or affecting.The sets and costumes are just OK; they do not detract (as in the stark & cartoonish Met production premiered in 2006); but they don't add much either, except for those worn by the Queen of the Night and Sarastro.Will Hartmann is not especially well cast as Tamino--it would be nice if he looked more youthful; however, in the world of operatic tenors, one could do a lot worse; and I am being especially picky here, but I must say that his intonation falls a touch short of the ideal in that it is not 100% secure, and he often lands a bit sharp on upward leaps.Franz-Josef Selig is convincing as Sarastro and has a voice that is rich throughout its range but especially impressive in the lower registers. At the risk of undermining my own credibility, I have to admit that I do not like the work of operatic basses very much; their bellowing is often wobbly & pitch-inaccurate. Once in a great while one runs across a bass who is fully in command of his instrument, but this is not one of those times. So that I don't malign all of bassdom, I'll mention that John Relyea and Bryn Terfel are excellent positive examples; unfortunately, both are bass-baritones rather than bassi profundi; and I have to admit that Selig's heft on the low notes is perfect for Sarastro.Adrian Thompson is suitably snarly & nasty as Monostatos. I have heard the role sung much more pleasantly by others, more for its musical beauty than dramatic character; here, however, Thompson trades prettiness for loathsomeness. Of course by that reasoning, a Papageno should have been chosen with more vulnerability in his voice, rather than the strength we get from Keenlyside. All things considered, if I had to be absolutely consistent, I'd say go with Keenlyside's musicality rather than Thompson's theatricality; but I am not upset to have both approaches in the same opera. The inconsistency in casting philosophy may, however, help to account for the lack of a sense of unity in this performance; there is little chemistry among the cast.Even though the Popageno-Papagena romance is nominally a side show next to the serious subject of \"rescuing\" Pamina, the former is the emotional center of the opera for me. The duet that starts off silly with the repetition of Popageno's and Papagena's names but then makes a turn into one of the most rapturous climaxes in all music. Productions can make a big deal of it or not and be dramatically true; but a great opportunity is lost if it is not played to the hilt, which, to change metaphors, means that the music has to be milked for all its considerable worth. It has to be allowed to breathe and reach its climax at full force with no rushing or glibness. This performance doesn't reach the height of the very best; but neither does it trivialize, even though the scene is played mostly for its comic value; and Keenlyside's & Ailish Tynan's rich voices provide an abundance of beauty and substance.To sum up, this is an expert performance, with many fine moments, that runs just a bit too much like clockwork. One of the reviews of the standard DVD version of this production gets it right: \"Flute, yes. Magic, no.\" Also among the reviews of the standard DVD, there is as of this writing a very accurate assessment of this production, which gives it two stars and is titled \"Disappointing,\" Although I rate the disc a little more highly, I find myself almost completely in agreement with the detailed assessment there, one exception being that, as noted above, I thought the chorus was rather good. When looking at reviews of a Blu-ray disc, for which there is only a small sample of opinion, it behooves one to look at the more plentiful reviews available for the standard-DVD issue.Finally, speaking of Blu-ray, this disc is technically fine, in 5.1 PCM audio, which is to say no matrixing or compression--each channel has at least the full quality of a CD. That is not to say that the miking and dynamic range are perfect, but they are quite good.

Lately I've been starting with One Little Victory and watching it from there just because the camera work is too annoying during much of the first half.I think they should recall this dvd, then let ME come in and do the video editing and I'd make the video portion of the dvd perfect.

Yes, all 4 films are here and all are presented wonderfully. But really, it's the extras here that are the star attractions for this release. By now, you have heard how large the extras are and how \"exhaustive\" they are. So wonderfully true. Going thru every disc and feeding on the special features that are here is an epic adventure in itself right along with the actual films. 9 discs in all!. Each film comes with a second disc full of all the bonus features. Almost every person imaginable is here and accounted for in the documentaries. There are featurettes on how the films got started, Pre-production featurettes, sketches, designs, trailers, differnt camera angle scenes, deleted/extended scenes, commentaries, photo galleries, special effects and creature designs, H.R. Giger, and so on. It seems endless. The bonus disc even has a new 64 minute documentary on the first film, a Ridley Scott Q&A and more. Seriously, you will be suffering from Alien overload once you are done with this set. You already know the films, so there is no real need to go into detail about every one. Each film comes in two versions - the original theatrical run, and a director's cut version. Some of those new cuts enhance the films(Aliens), some are unnecessary(Alien), and some just don't make that much of a difference(Alien 3 and 4). 1979's \"Alien\" is a classic masterpiece. Truly original and brilliant. The extras are great. Where is Yaphett Kotto and Ian Holm?. 1986's \"Aliens\" was one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron isn't as involved as other directors in the new features, but he is there. I find the documentaries and behind the scenes features here the most interesting. The demanding Cameron, the clashes with the London crew, and so on. Good stuff. 1992's \"Alien 3\" was where it fell apart. Fincher is a great director, and there are some good moments, but it was a major disappointment. The documentaries and features are far more fascinating. Once you watch them, you may feel for Fincher and how Alien 3 was an uphill battle from the get go. Fincher is also the only director who doesn't appear in new interviews for this set. 1997's \"Alien Resurrection\" was an improvement, but by no means was anywhere near as good as the first two. Writer Joss Whedon(of Buffy fame)has condemned the film every chance he gets. Resurrection is entertaining and has some good moments and factors to it. The film is not great, but it's not the unwatchable abomination Whedon thinks it is. If not that isn't enough, the set comes with a booklet that has a small overview of every film, and tells you where the extras are, what can be found on each disc, and their running time. The Alien Quadrilogy set is a mammoth experience that hasn't been matched yet. I can't imagine what it would take to even go further than this box set. The Alien films are batting 2 out of 4, but even the lesser films are better than a lot of other stuff that is out there.

The '79 release is better (the additional scenes in the '03 release were not needed. Ironically enough, I own the 1992 special edition laserdisc edition & through the use of a highend VCR I edited the deleted scenes back into the final film. That was in 1999. So when I saw the 2003 S.E., I wasn't really that impressed since my copy of the film matched Scott's new edition). The saving grace on the 2003 edition is the DTS track (sounds awesome!).Disc 2 has all the supplemental docs & featurettes on the making, production, & releasing of the '79 classic.\"Aliens\" - the best out of the four. Released 20 years ago today (7/18/1986), \"Aliens\" is one of the best sequels in film history right up there with \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Terminator 2\", & \"The Godfather Part II\". It's also, arguably the best film James Cameron has done outside of his \"Terminator\" films (yes, that includes \"Titanic\").Disc 3 has the 1986 theatrical release & the 1991 special edition. The special edition is the one to go with for \"Aliens\". The added scenes give more character to Ripley.

It doesn't really matter which version you watch, it's still \"Alien 3\".Disc 6 has all the docs & featurettes to \"Alien 3\", but, the one thing disc 6 can't do is, explain why David Fincher refused to be interviewed or help restore the workprint copy of \"Alien 3\".\"Alien Resurrection\" - the series runs out of gas & becomes cliched with this third sequel. Sigourney Weaver got a producer credit on this film (as well as an 11 million dolar salary for her return as Ripley). Joss Whedon, of \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\", helped write the story & script. \"Alien Resurrection\" is a mess strung together with a few decent action scenes & nothing else.Disc 7 contains both the theatrical version as well as the extended opening version with disc 8 housing all documetaries & featurettes.The ninth disc doesn't have a lot of new stuff if you previously owned the laserdisc special editions to \"Alien\" & \"Aliens\". The laserdisc archives from both of those editions are here as well as the usual trailers & t.v. spots. There is a cool featurette on hollywood monster caretaker Bob Burns & how he aquired all of the props from the four \"Alien\" films.

The ninth disc is a hodgepodge of trailers and other items from previous DVD and laser disk versions. Although the extras have been released in a variety of forms over several years (the John Hurt documentary 'The Alien Saga', being the latest), THIS is the definitive version.Alien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series] (see my review). If you haven't seen this classic film, then you must be living under a rock. The collection includes the original theatrical version (which I prefer) and the \"Director's Cut\", notable for its inclusion of the controversial captain-cocooned by alien scene (controversial because from the Alien mythology developed in later films, we know that only the massive queen can lay eggs). I prefer the original (which is actually 1 minute longer), and interestingly enough, it appears that Ridley Scott prefers the original as well. The making of featurettes is extensive and reveals Giger's extensive participation and how what was originally expected to receive a b-movie budget became one of the very few examples where Fox studios followed the vision with a classic.Aliens(see my review). This is the only sequel I know of that is rated higher than the original. This time, the \"Special Edition\" version (also on the previous 'Alien Legacy' box set) is a superior experience and exactly is how upstart director James Cameron (who had written the script prior to the release of 'The Terminator') wanted to release the film, but was constrained entirely by time limits. The result is additional scenes featuring the colonists and Ripley's family lost to the time she spent in hypersleep. As with the first installment, the featurettes are interesting and thorough, although the Viet Nam War metaphor is not as thoroughly explored with Cameron as has been in other releases.Alien 3(see my review). As a fan of the franchise, this was perhaps the most anticipated part of this new box set. The \"working print\" of the film (the longest of all the versions here, and complete with subtitles for missed sound editing), adds a depth to the film that was not in the original. That is, the arrival of Ripley and the characters are covered much more thoroughly, the alien creature is begotten by an oxen with a much more original look, there is an additional plot twist arising from the nature of the inhabitants (criminally delusional), and there is no ridiculously-timed chest-buster scene at the end. Still, the film is a flawed masterpiece. The film is better appreciated in light of the bad situation first-time director David Fincher had been placed in - not the least of which is an incomplete script during production and a set that had already been constructed for the ill-conceived \"wooden planet/monetary\" vision of the previously assigned director. In this sense, the three production featurettes come across as almost an apology/tribute to Fincher. (NOTE: Fincher is the only director who is not interviewed on the box set.)Alien Resurrection(see my review). What happens when you put the French director of 'Amelie' (Jean-Pierre Jeaunet) in charge of an alien movie? Well, foreign/art movies were all the craze in the last 1990s, so . . . Fox studios thought, \"Why not?\" In the end, many fans of the franchise did not appreciate the obviously satirical slant on this final installment. The opening scene and ending scenes (the only additions of substance) on the extended version make the film even more tongue-in-cheek. Despite the French director and crew's obvious regard for the original 'Alien' (as documented in the featurettes), armed with the return of Sigourney Weaver and the addition of superstar Winona Ryder, the director ultimately made a quirky, campy action film. But in the end, it was the last quarter of the script that makes this the weakest of all the installments by far. Postscript to Fox studios: if you had given Fincher this much creative freedom, you would have had a third masterpiece.This is a must have set for fans of Alien.Highly recommended for fans of Alien, Sigourney weaver, and the slimy reptilian creature, which might be back some day.

I'm not talking about a few bad scenes, either; this film starts out bad and goes downhill from there.  Just because you put a bunch of kids in the woods, throw in a few crazy rednecks, dump buckets of blood all over the place, and rip off a number of scenes from old horror classics, it doesn't mean you've made a good horror movie.I hardly know where to start on this one.  I knew there was going to be a problem from the very start.  You have a bunch of kids celebrating the end of exams by going camping for a week, then you can't help but notice the woods covered with fallen leaves.  What kind of school has final exams in autumn, for Pete's sake?  And these kids - each one is very different from the others, yet they are all equally impossible to like.  \"Frat Guy\" man is one of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered.  Normally, when you watch horror, there's at least one character you fervently hope lives through the ordeal - not so here.  I was ready to see all five of the main characters taken out after spending just a few minutes with them.I guess I should mention the premise of this thing.  Basically, these five kids have their good time ruined by some strange hermit with a serious skin condition - he can't keep his skin on his body, to be exact.  It's a similar setup to Evil Dead, only the source of the trouble here is a flesh-eating virus.  As you might expect, the kids start getting the same disease one by one, begin to turn on each other, blah blah blah.  Their efforts to get help are thwarted by their own incompetence as well as the attitude of the local rednecks they encounter.  I was desperately pulling for the virus, and it could not do its work quickly enough to satisfy me, as this film felt like it would never end.  There is a lot of blood in Cabin Fever, and that's normally a good thing, but once you've seen some walking rotten corpse projectile-vomiting blood a few times, it loses some of its appeal.  I guess I can say that the special effects weren't too bad overall, though.  The music, though, was awful.  I have to question the whole vision thing of young director Eli Roth; it's as if he periodically inserted a few silly montages and highly discordant music for no reason other than to make his movie look slightly artistic.Many of the gorier parts of the film come straight from classics such as Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead - as such, they did not impress me at all, especially those that happened during the very late and supposedly climactic moments of the movie.  The so-called comedy that is interspersed throughout Cabin Fever is not even groan-worthy for the most part.  There is one exception to this, though, and this is the closest thing this film has to a saving grace of any kind: the very last scene is absolutely hilarious - and that's all I'm going to say about it.When it comes to the Special Features, let me just say that I watched them so you won't have to.  There's a half-hour documentary on the making of the film, a really stupid Family Friendly Version of Cabin Fever, really low-quality (and thankfully short) video of a martial artist wannabe, and three short animated films starring The Rotten Fruit - rotten is truly the key word here.  There are five commentaries of the film, but there's no way I could sit through this film a second time, let alone five more times.  There's also a Chick-Vision option for watching the film.All in all, in almost every way possible, Cabin Fever is just a very unimpressive horror movie.  It's not scary, it's not funny, the gore does nothing to instill squeamishness, the script is weak, and the soundtrack is a constant source of annoyance.  Doggone it, I looked forward to seeing this film, expecting good things from it, and I was just bitterly disappointed.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the movie?", "id": "0d76d9d5fa09d48af74fc9ebd6dbbf7c", "answers": [{"text": "dreadful horror film", "answer_start": 100}]}]}, {"context": "Ok, ok...so I saw this in the theater 2 years ago when it was released.

I like horror movies, I hadn't seen it in a while, and it was only $5...So,  I thought \"what the hell?\" I'll buy it and add it to my collection.  I should have spent the $5 on the gumball machines in the lobby of the discount store instead, honestly.  I am typically NOT one to knock horror since it's my favorite genre and I especially love the cheesy ones, but this movie has a serious identity problem. It tries to be horror/funny much like EVIL DEAD 2 and it fails, no make that TERRIBLY fails at doing that. It starts out promising enough, kinda a mix between Wrong Turn and Friday the 13th.  YES, the script is terrible (unless you think uttering the F word in place of anything else is creative).  The characters are all hollow, stupid and unsympathetic, even for a cheesy horror film (except for the blonde girl).  Rider Strong was probably the best part about this movie, and that ain't sayin much considering his claim to fame was that TGIF show \"Boys Meets World\".  You should know the plot by now from reading the actual summary listed on this website, so I won't go into the whole \"flesh eating virus\" bit.  Basically, it's nasty.  Gross.  Unnecessarily BAD.  Why does the girl insist on shaving her legs when she knowingly has something that looks like Herpes of the leg?  It tries to be overly gross just to see how far it can go.  The normal, typical movie viewer will probably find this movie GOD AWFUL, hard core horror fans may find it watchable (I actually found it watchable, but it's not good).  There is probably a small audience that loves this movie, I can probably see why, but I don't connect with that reasoning.

However, as with &quot;Pirates Of The Carribean,&quot; the wonderful Johnny Depp singled-handedly makes this film an instant classic.  Honestly, who could have pulled off the role of Sands any better than Depp did? His gunfight with two men, after his eyes have been gouged out, is truly one of the most incredible moments captured on recent film - funny and leaving you shaking your head. In fact, Depp's character is so raw and abrasive that you absolutely hate Sands' guts - until he is blinded. Then he emotes such a sense of empathy and revenge that you have to root for him. Truly a remarkable performance, and a darn shame that it will be passed over come Oscar time. This is one of the best supporting roles that I have ever seen in an action film.  Aside from Depp, there really isn't much character depth. But Robert Rodriguez, as usual, ellicits great performances from mediocre actors - a true testament to what a great director he is. Rodriguez's lightning fast editing makes this film seem like it flys by in about a half an hour. The action scenes are well staged and beautifully choreographed, like a ballet. Rodriguez has truly proven with this film that he is the West's version of John Woo. Most of this film was shot by Rodriguez himself with a hand-held digital camera, giving this project an underground film feel. He keeps the action crisp and taut - with his usual heaping helping of deliciously over the top gunfights - and he never lingers on a scene too long to make the audience realize that there really isn't that much of a plot. Rodriguez wrote this just to have all of these characters meet and shoot up half of Mexico, and God bless him for it! This film will sit quite nicely along its predecesors (&quot;Marachi&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;) and &quot;O.U.A.T.I.M.&quot; will make Rodriguez's revenge trilogy this generations &quot;Man With No Name&quot; trilogy. It's obvious to see the influences of Leone, Woo and Tarantino laced throughout this film, which isn't a bad thing. Again, it is Depp's performance that makes this film outstanding.

However, the American is taken hostage by the Samurai during a battle and soon befriends the Samurai village. The Last Samurai is a story of love, spirit, and, most of all, a sacred honor which guides us all.The battle scenes, while gruesome (if you're squeamish, you might avoid this one), were amazing.

A Civil War era soldier who finds himself thrown in the middle of a different culture and ends up embracing it and becoming part of it.However, Edward Zwick's film differs from the Kevin Costner Oscar winner in that the principal character, Lt. Nathan Algren (Cruise) is down on his luck, having become a drunken caricature of his former self, deeply regretful of his actions, who accepts a job as an instructor for an incipient Japanese army that needs to be prepared to fight against the Samurai.As he arrives to Tokyo he starts training a useless bunch of would-be soldiers who are sent to fight even if they're not ready for it. As a result, the newly formed army gets butchered by the battle experienced Samurai. During that battle, Algren fights bravely and kills one of the highest ranking warriors, getting the interest of the famed Katsumoto, the last great Samurai leader, who orders him captured and brought to his son's village as a prisoner.Once there, Algren's life is changed forever as he gets to know the real lifestyle of the Samurai and their people. They turn out not to be the savages that the Japanese government makes them out to be. After spending winter with them, Algren \"changes sides\" and joins the Samurai in fighting the Emperor's army.The title of the movie tells the final outcome. The Samurai lose the battle. Progress triumphs over tradition. New over old. But Algren's past demons are redeemed by his courageous actions helping the Samurai.The true worth of this movie is its look. You can definetely see where the budget went (other than Cruise's salary). A whole village was built and the attention to detail is astonishing. The costumes are simply amazing, especially the battle armors. The costume designer is Ngila Dickson, who also worked in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Also of notice are the battle scenes, which are breathtaking. Very violent, but not gratuitous, they serve the story very well.As for the acting, Cruise does a fine job, and is slowly but consistently becoming a better actor (even if this particular performance was not nominated for an Academy Award), but the movie belongs to Ken Watanabe (who was indeed nominated) as Katsumoto.

Servants are servile and illiterate, though not necessarily unintelligent. The titular teenage maid does not have an insolent attitude.Scarlett Johansson plays the young Griet, the daughter of a former tile painter who is sent across town to serve the Vermeer household. Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), a painter, is drawn to Griet's quiet loveliness. Though few words pass between them, their mutual eye for aesthetics develops into strong attraction and deep appreciation. Her pure complexion also attracts Vermeer's vulgar patron, Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) and the young butcher Pieter (Cillian Murphy).Each frame is a painting within itself, supported by a charming score (though some have called the music obnoxious). Though every scene is beautiful, Griet's position is not romanticized; her arduous labor is evident throughout the movie. Instead of altering the story to conform to a 95 minute film, sections of the story are simply deleted or unexplained. Particularly the character of Tanneke is underdeveloped, compared to the book character.The acting is dramatic yet understated. Expressions are affectively portrayed without losing subtlety. Johansson expressively displays the young, almost timid side of Griet. Colin Firth is an attractive Vermeer; he has natural and exciting reactions. Tom Wilkinson is surprisingly low key as Van Ruijven, compared to the character in the novel; however, he still manages to be repulsive.

As with any horror film, the big pay-off is the creep-out factor. Just the premise alone here is ample reason for nightmares.

Unfortunately, this time around, newcomer director Zack Snyder chose to give the zombies the ability to run, fight, jump and stalk. What this shows is that the director just doesn't understand. You don't NEED go any farther than promote a feeling of dread and dire hopelessness to make this film work. You don't need (and shouldn't have) running combat scenes as if this were some horrific \"re-imagining\" of \"Die Hard.\"This film is, of course, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. The overall plot is vaguely similar, with several people hold up in a shopping mall surrounded by thousands of the undead outside, banging on the doors. But there the similarities end. Ana (Sarah Polly) is a nurse who wakes to see her husband being killed, who then promptly gets up and attacks her, too. After the mad dash, she hooks up with Ving Rhames and some others who run into a mostly vacant shopping mall. After it becomes evident that no help is forthcoming, our motley bunch must use their wits (what's left of them) to survive.I must say that I wanted to like this film. I recently saw a piece of the original \"Dawn\" on TV and even 15 minutes scared the wits right out of me. When I was younger, I'd seen this film many times and it never failed to scare me. What the original had, which this updated version lacks, is the hopelessness. The feeling of overwhelming dread. BECAUSE the older films didn't have special effects to fall back on, they had to have more inter-personal story. I wish this new version would have given us some time to get to know these people, add some back-story.That is not to say that there weren't some chills. There were some scenes where my nerves were tested. But even in those scenes, they were tense mainly because the director constricted the field-of-view or turned down the lights. These are old, tired cinematic tricks. That, and the characters were doing foolish things like wasting ammo target shooting at zombies, for fun. I must say, I fail to understand why our hapless band are smiling and laughing. There is nothing at all funny about this situation:*They are surrounded by a sea of zombies who mean them harm.*NO ONE is coming to save them.*For all they know, this is a world-wide meltdown.*All of their family and friends are likely dead, or worse.*They have a finite food and ammo supply.*They have absolutely no idea where they can go for safety*or how they're going to get there, if they did*they're in a building with hundreds of unguardable doors and windows*They are ALONE, unprepared, under siege, and will likely die---tomorrow, or maybe in the next 10 minutes......and there is something to smile about? I don't think so. I don't see what's so darn funny. What should have been a story to chill the blood instead deteriorated into a cookie-cutter film not much different from your typical \"them against us\" action-oriented fare.At the end of the original film, it ends on the roof with a helicopter, something like this: \"How much fuel do we have?\" \"I don't know.....Not much.\" \"all right then, let's go.\" And they fly off into the abyss.I only wish this remake could have given us at least that much feeling.

Perhaps it's just because it's science-fiction.  Who knows?  Bottom line is this: I doubt the naysayers have taken the time to digest this incredible 1st season of \"Star Trek\". How could a show with such wonderful questions about humanity, leadership, morality, and discovery be so dismissed?  My guess, people are looking at the surface too much and have watched too many parodies and mockeries.  I've always been a fan, but ever since I took the time to watch this Re-mastered DVD set from start to finish, I am begging people to give this show a serious chance.I've provided an episode-by-episode breakdown in the hopes of convincing you...as well as just for my general amusement and reflections.  I've placed it at the end because this review will be too long for Amazon guidelines.\"Star Trek\" wasn't a huge success in the 1960s.  Its 3 seasons only gained popularity when they were re-run in the 1970s.  After watching how strong the show began, it puzzles me that people didn't want to give it more of a strong run compared to other run-of-the-mill programming.  \"Star Trek\" is often remembered for its sci-fi action, alien worlds, strange catchphrases, and occasionally-dated production.  One aspect the show doesn't get nearly enough credit for is its acting.  That's right...\"Acting\".  William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley make a terrific team as our three lead roles as the strong-willed Captain Kirk, the logical and emotionally-restrained Spock, and the passionately blunt Dr. McCoy.  Nimoy's performance as Spock often got the most recognition for playing a character that everyone could relate to: the outcast whose scientific and distanced way of thinking often made him the go-to guy when situations were dire.  In a way, Spock was the one we all thought we needed to be.  Kirk, on the other hand, was the one we all wanted to be.  His courage and willingness to get his hands dirty and assume responsibility are among the most admirable qualities in a human being.  The great thing about Shatner is that you can tell from his facial expressions that when his crew are in danger, he feels their pain.  There's a terrific episode in which a newlywed has lost his life during combat --- Kirk's expression of pain in the face of duty says it all.  And McCoy is the one to keep us in.  He's our voice of emotion, the one who says what he feels because someone's gotta break the laws of duty and logic.  He's out gut reaction, and Kelley is a very welcome change-of-pace from the other doctors \"Star Trek\" tried to use before `Bones' McCoy.As I hope you'll see in my upcoming episode synopses, \"Star Trek\" (its first 2 seasons anyway) had a great selection of adventures putting humanity and morality to the test.  Although the characters wouldn't endure life-changing events from one show to the next, you can feel what they're feeling during the episode itself.  The most underrated aspect of this original \"Star Trek\" series is its drama and its combination of sci-fi adventure and explorations of morals & ethics.I won't say a whole lot about the Re-mastered effects, except that I think they actually improve the show.  Every single episode with new effects (probably all of them) is better because while they look sharper and less fake, they still respect the original photography and spirit of the 1960s broadcasts.  There's really not much to gripe about unless you're a purist who only wants the original product.  If you're willing to accept a little shine here and there, jump right in.  It's the rare update that works (sorry George Lucas).The third and final season of \"Star Trek\" wasn't very good, but judging from this impressive 1st season, you wouldn't have guessed it would've ended up that way.(Quick Note - Don't let the chronological Star Dates confuse you with your DVD sets.  Just watch the show from Disc 1 onward.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, shoot me a comment.)*****EPISODE REVIEWS*****1) The Man Trap---Sadly, this is one of the weakest episodes of the season, as officers from the Enterprise notice a scientist's wife has a different appearance to each man's eyes.  Suddenly, officers are being found dead on the remote planet.  Gee, wonder who might be responsible for it?  (6.5 / 10)------------------------------2) Charlie X---The Enterprise is tasked with carrying a young boy whose emotional needs grow dangerous when he doesn't get his way.  Starts promising enough, with some good questions about how the crew should handle a young man's struggles with adulthood.  Unfortunately, the psychological strategy to save the ship isn't entirely convincing.  (7.0 / 10)------------------------------3) Where No Man Has Before---This is the pilot that got \"Star Trek\" launched into a weekly TV show, and it's actually one of my favorites.  After encountering a dangerous space storm, an officer and a visiting psychologist begin to exhibit God-like abilities.  I love this episode because it shows the real anguish that Kirk feels with imprisoning and (possibly) killing one of his best friends when his ego cannot control his newfound powers.  And the psychologist's resistance to reason and fascination with power is very well-developed.  The final fistfight is a bit much, but since it helped get \"Star Trek\" on the air, I'll forgive it.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------4) The Naked Time---One of the funnier episodes, as crew members contract a disease from an abandoned outpost, causing madness aboard the Enterprise.  Memorable images include the iconic sword-bearing Sulu, as well as a navigator taking over the Engine Room, giving hilarious announcements about ice cream socials and formal dances.  And how the Enterprise is saved from crashing into the planet is...unexpected.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------5) The Enemy Witihin---A malfunction with the Enterprise strands on a freezing planet below, while the ship is boarded by...Captain Kirk's evil clone!  Aside from some unintentionally funny moments (\"IIIIIIIIIIII'M CAPTAIN KIRRRRRRRRK!\"), this is a compelling story where Kirk's personality has literally been split into two people, with the ability to command being within the darker side.  While it might feel repetitive to have yet another \"chaos-aboard-the-Enterprise/imposter\" episode, this one manages to overcome those possible slipups.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------6) Mudd's Women---This episode feels pretty dated, but the first half of it is interesting as a smuggler/hustler is transporting three women so beautiful that they distract the attentions of the ship's crew.  The episode missteps when it deals with the truth and consequences behind the ladies' beauty.  I don't want to give it away for new viewers, but I believe most will find the message to be a product of the 60s.  (7.5 / 10)------------------------------7) What Are Little Girls Made Of?---I don't think episode gets nearly enough credit.  Captain Kirk and Nurse Chapel beam down to a famous archaeologist's dig site.  Dr. Corby was once engaged to Nurse Chapel, and then disappeared for 5 years.  But matters get more complicated when Corby's giant bodyguard kills off two security guards in order to imprison Kirk and Chapel.  If you can get past Corby's giant bodyguard and the sexy assistant, there is a great story about how robots can never replace mankind.  There's also some touching moments as both Nurse Chapel and the assistant struggle to show feelings for men who are so unlike them.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------8) Miri---While some very 60s elements rear their ugly heads into the episode, this is still a very fine story as the crew stranded on an Earth-like planet race to find a cure for a plague that will kill them in less than a week.  Things get more interesting when they find a young woman hiding out, while a gang of children taunts and prevents the crew from getting modern technology to research a cure.  The gang of kids are very corny, except for Michael J. Pollard as their leader.  And how Kirk manages to reason with them is a bit hard to believe they'd listen (same problem with the \"Charlie X\" episode).  But overall, this is a very solid race-against-time episode.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------9) Dagger of the Mind---I've yet to find anyone who loves this episode as much as I do.  When a prison inmate stows away onto the Enterprise, further examination reveals he was formerly a scientist working for the reform facility.  Things get darker and more disturbing when Kirk and a former love interest find out how exactly the prison rehabilitates its prisoners.  Throw in the first use of Spock's ability to mind-meld and a thriller that never lets up, you've got a cutting-edge classic.  There are plenty of beloved \"Star Trek\" episodes, but this hidden gem deserves more recognition.  (10 / 10 Perfect!)------------------------------10) The Corbomite Maneuver---This episode has a terrific buildup, a nail-biting premise that goes on a little too long, and a love-it-or-hate-it ending.  A space buoy of great power follows the Enterprise everywhere it navigates in space.  When they finally resort to destroying it, an unknown species threatens to use their power to destroy the ship, leaving them only 10 minutes to prepare for their ultimate doom.  If that doesn't get your attention, I don't know what will.  Kirk comes up with a clever plan to delay their destruction.  What the crew eventually discovers about their opponent is totally unpredictable; whether that's good or not depends on your taste.  I actually liked it, especially after a wonderful final line of dialogue that sums up Captain Kirk pretty well.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------11) & 12) The Menagerie: Parts I & II---This is a tough two-parter to critique.  On the one hand, it's a glorified reason to replay \"The Cage\", the very first pilot of \"Star Trek\" that was turned down for various reasons.  On the other hand, the story of how Christopher Pike (former captain of the Enterprise) was challenged and tested on the forbidden planet Talos IV hadn't been shown to viewers when this two-parter premiered.  There are some surprising elements when Spock deceives and manipulates the Enterprise to return to Talos IV, testing the Kirk/Spock relationship like never before.  Overall, if you've seen or know a lot about \"The Cage\", the new story might not be enough for you.  But if you have no idea what \"The Cage\" is, you're in for a very unique vision of what \"Star Trek\" almost was.  Either way, it's a credit to the writers and production team that they turned they gave this gimmick a few surprising plot twists and a dramtically-satisfying ending.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------13) The Conscience of the King---This episode can't really be called \"sci-fi\", but instead you get a terrific drama with true Shakespearean pathos.  The premise is a bit light at first: Could the veteran actor of an interstellar acting troupe really be a longdead dictator?  If so, is he responsible for a couple attempted murders?  The reason this episode succeeds very well is because of 'HOW' it's told, as it uses a lot of unique storytelling devices.  An engineer gets temporary relief when Uhura plays a beautiful song over the speaker, unaware that he's about to be poisoned.  When Kirk confronts his alleged nemesis (played terrifically by Arnold Moss), their dialogue reveals painful depths about the two men.  How can Kirk know if he's right?  And if so, who cares?  The story begins and ends during Shakespeare plays, and the way the playwright's words are used to punctuate the drama is amazing.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------14) Balance of Terror---Rightfully remembered as one of the best \"Star Trek\" episodes.  In short, the Enterprise races to investigate space outposts that are being attacked along the border between Federation space and the mysterious Romulans.  What ensues is a suspenseful battle in space, as both starships seek to destory the other, before the other can report that a peace treaty has been violated.  Although the Re-mastered special effects make this episode better, the reason it really works is because the camera and script focus on the characters' reactions, rather than just creating a visual space battle.  Also, special credit must be given to Mark Lenard's superb performance as the Romulan Commander.  The finale is also a heartbreaker, as Kirk must deal with the death of one of his crew.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------15) Shore Leave---The best way I can describe this episode is that it's just one damn thing after another.  The Enterprise crew find a lush, beautiful planet that would be perfect for them to relax during their five-year mission.  However, the first few officers who explore the planet find experience some bizarre hallucinations.  It begins with Dr. McCoy seeing a giant white rabbit being followed by a girl who looks just like Alice of Wonderland.  All sorts of craziness occurs from a giant tiger prowling the planet to Kirk being tormented by his Irish bully from the Academy days.  In fact, the Kirk/Finnegan rivalry is one of the most comically insane threads of any \"Star Trek\" plot.  The ending is a tiny copout as everything wraps up a little too tidily.  But like the Enterprise crew, all I could do was just laugh at what the hell everybody just went through.  (10 / 10 I Loved It!)------------------------------16) The Galileo Seven---This one takes a big chance of taking the often-infallible Spock, and making him even more unlikeable than in \"The Menagerie\".  A shuttlecraft is stranded on a planet within a space quasar.  Meanwhile, Captain Kirk's efforts to rescue them are constantly scolded by a galactic commissioner who only gives Kirk a few days before meeting a deadline for delivering medical supplies.  Spock's non-emotional, logical leadership starts to wear down on the other 6 officers who fear they may never leave the planet alive.  With no fuel and attacking creatures, the situation becomes dire very fast.  This episode has one major problem: the attacks on the Galileo Seven party are laughably bad.  Gigantic spears look phony, and the creatures' close-quarters attacks are as slow as zombies.  Plus, the nagging commissioner aboard the Enterprise is very one-note.  This is a very good episode that explores some gray areas within Spock, but the faulty aspects stick out pretty bad.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------17) The Squire of Gothos---In many ways, this is what the \"Charlie X\" episode should've been.  After Captain Kirk and Sulu vanish from the bridge, the party sent to investigate the nearby planet finds that they've been taken from a charming egotistical being who fancies his lifestyle after the romanticising of European wars (Napolean for example).  What's so great about this episode is that Trelane (the villain played with great relish by William Campbell) doesn't have a deep philosophy for his actions.  He's simply a bored unknown entity who just wants some humans to play with and has no moral boundaries whatsoever, despite how well-educated he appears to be.  It's a frightening situation with a great nemesis, and the way the Enterprise crew struggles to reason their way out of this one is something to behold.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------18) Arena---Action-packed is the best way to summarize this episode.  When the Enterprise crew finds an Earth colony has been bombarded by an alien race, Kirk goes on a vengeful mission to lead the Enterprise to hunt down the attackers.  However, his anger will soon cost him as an unseen race called The Metrons force the pursuit to stop.  Furthermore, they force Kirk and The Gorn to battle it out on an isolated planet.  Winner gets to leave, the loser's ship will be destroyed.  I'm surprised how the unlikely story of an obsessive Captain Kirk is very well-told, and his redemption is compelling.  But quite frankly, the one-on-one battle with The Gorn is bad even by 60s standards, and when the Enterprise is conveniently allowed to watch, it insults our intelligence a bit.  I wish this one had trusted the audience more to enjoy the story, but besides those missteps, this one's a keeper.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------19) Tomorrow Is Yesterday---The great thing about this episode is that when the Enterprise accidentally travels back in time to the 1960s, it deals with the consequences seriously.  After saving an Air Force pilot's life and escaping Earth's orbit, everyone must cope with how either the 1960s or the 23rd Century timelines will be changed forever.  The Enterprise can't risk sending the pilot back to Earth because he could use his newfound knowledge to change the world, but wouldn't detaining him be just as wrong?  After all, the unsuspecting pilot was only doing his duty when he stumbled upon their vessel.  There are a lot of great elements.  When Kirk & Sulu sneak into the Air Force base, the story gets a bit ridiculous.  But it's all in good fun.  Like many \"Star Trek\" episodes, it may wrap up a little too neatly and too quickly, but all in all, this one is another strong effort.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------20) Court Martial---It may be a little redundant having two officer-on-trial episodes in this first season.  The difference is that in \"The Menagerie\", Spock was well aware of his guilty actions.  In this courtroom mystery, Kirk is absolutely certain he is innocent, and actually challenges the trial to take him on.  It's a fascinating premise, made more interesting that a former love interest must dutifully prosecute Kirk to the fullest extent of the law.  The lawyer that Kirk employs is also a neat character, a man who tries to get the heart of the law.  The big problem working against this episode is that Captain Kirk is such a believable character that it's obvious that someone made a mistake somewhere with this trial, making his guilt pretty much a falsehood.  And since \"Star Trek\" isn't known for long-term consequences, we trust that all will be well before the hour is up.  But for what it is and how well it sustains its premise, \"Court Martial\" is good from start to finish.  (8.0 / 10)------------------------------21) The Return of the Archons---This one's plot has a very bizarre & intriguing start, as people on a planet (dressed like late 19th century Earth) are under a constant trance, speaking in tongues, praising \"Landru\".  Somehow, the investigating crew find shelter with a few people who fear Landru, but speak plainly enough to be of some help.  Unfortunately, I thought this one drags for a while, finally gaining much-needed momentum in its final act.  Furthermore, the cult/religion of the Archons is never fully explained, with Kirk & Spock solving the mystery before we can even follow how they did it.  It's not a bad episode, but I loved some of it, while getting restless during other parts.  (7.5 / 10)------------------------------22) Space Seed---Even if \"Star Trek II\" had never taken place, this TV episode would rightfully be remembered for being a masterful piece of work.  The Enterprise find a wandering spaceship with its passengers cryogenically-frozen.  The one they wake up turns out to be a grave mistake.  First and foremost, Khan (amazingly played by Ricardo Montalban) is one of the best antagonists in all of TV.  As he says, he's superior in every way to the normal man.  Khan is very strong, supremely intelligent, romantically appealing to women (particularly an Enterprise historian), and a man who hungers for global conquest.  The way Khan interacts with any member of the Enterprise crew is well-executed and gripping.  His attempts to gain control of the Enterprise are patient and subtle.  And when Khan begins to execute his plan, this episode is constantly exciting.  And even if we never got a 2nd \"Star Trek\" movie, the final words between Kirk and the crew are harrowing.  If you're gonna watch only one episode of \"Star Trek\", make it this one.  (10 / 10 Totally Mesmerizing!)------------------------------23) A Taste of Armageddon---What a delightfully strange concept this episode has.  Basically, Captain Kirk and his crew beam down to a planet that appears peaceful, but they insist that they've been at war for a nearby planet for 500 years, killing millions of each other's inhabitants.  The catch: They don't really kill each other; instead, the two engage in 'computerized' war games, and agree to sacrifice their own people so that 'real' nuclear weapons won't be used.  There are so many opportunities for implicating society and creating nail-biting suspense, and I think this story takes advantage of all of them.  There is a Federation diplomat onboard the Enterprise who has command of the ship, and for once, it's not a one-note character.  This diplomat wants to sincerely bring good relations between the isolated planet and the Federation, but he has absolutely no idea what he's getting into.  Kirk and his crew beam down with peaceful news, but they are informed almost immediately that they've been chosen to die from the war games.  The action is plentiful, as Kirk's landing party fight to escape their own euthanasia, while the Enterprise must refrain from firing back at a planet who means to destory them.  And the questions posed to us --- Is it better to kill your own people rather than allow someone else's weapons to do so?  Do we have the right to intervene with another people's way of life if the earthly world isn't being harmed?  I loved just about every second of this episode, and I recommend it highly!  (10 / 10 Genius!)------------------------------24) This Side of Paradise---This season continues to show its variety of concepts, themes, and tones.  Evidence: A love story for Spock?!  The Enterprise is ordered to bring some colonists off of their planet to another starbase.  The problem is that they're so healthy and so content that they don't want to leave.  Meanwhile, a woman who's loved Spock for years finally gets her chance when the Vulcan is infected with some plant spores that bring his emotions to the surface.  Soon, everyone but Kirk (conveniently) is exposed to the spores and refuses to keep the Enterprise running and leave the planet.  There's nothing really wrong with this episode, but for some reason, I wanted more from it.  Maybe I was underwhelmed by Kirk being the one who solves the mystery and saves the day.  But if for nothing else, this glimpse into Spock's heart is unforgettable.  (8.5 / 10)------------------------------25) The Devil In The Dark---The way this story surpasses its simple premise is incredible: Some miners are being attacked by an unknown creature, and the Enterprise is tasked to stop it before it permenantly stops production & kills everyone on the planet.  But thanks to some smart pacing and a sensible mystery, it all works.  The Kirk/Spock dynamic is well-challanged: The Captain wants to save lives, while Spock doesn't want to miss an opportunity to research an unknown creature.  The way the two friends challenge and ultimately trust the other's philosophies is great stuff.  The cave creature is, at first, disappointing because it's typical monster-movie stuff where people are killed and you can't see it.  But once Kirk & Spock find the creature, it's a surprisingly sharp creation.  It moves convincingly in the way it breathes, the way it creeps, and the way it feels.  Dr. McCoy's involvement in the story is quite amusing, too.  Once you get past the monster-movie setup --- and forgive how the survivors fail to mourn the dead after surviving the ordeal --- this is another unforgettable episode.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------26) Errand of Mercy---Ah, the debut of the Klingons!  I don't think they could've done a better job of introducing these \"Trek\" icons into the universe.  The peaceful planet of Organia is caught in the crossfire between the Federation and Klingon battles in space.  But when Kirk and Spock beam down to convince the primitive Organians to allow the Federation to assist them, they refuse simply because they denounce any kind of violence, regardless if it's in self-defense.  When the Klingon occupation begins, Kirk and Spock are the only ones who want their tyrannical reign to end.  Special credit must go to John Abbott & John Colicos as the Organian Elder and Klingon Commander Kor, respectively, for their great performances here.  The Organians' peaceful reaction to all of this is off-putting to us, which is part of the story's lesson.  And when Kor & Kirk engage in their verbal battles of wits, you can't take your eyes off the screen.  My only big gripe is that I can't decide if the episode's big reveal at the end was supposed to be expected, or if it was supposed to be a surprise.  In a way, I was underwhelmed by either solution because there's a big cheat in the middle of the episode that keen-eyed viewers will notice.  But it still makes for a powerful ending, and makes us question the way we wanted the violent adventure to continue.  (9.0 / 10)------------------------------27) The Alternative Factor---Man, this episode really fumbles after a decent start.  Basically, there are inexplicable storms that are causing damage to ships across the entire galaxy.  The Enterprise learns that a maniacal space traveler aboard an empty planet seems to be the cause.  How he's involved with these storms isn't too surprising, because there about 5 of them throughout the story.  But the bigger problem is that they keep leaving this traveler alone when they shouldn't.  Dr. McCoy literally sits by the Sickbay's door, and yet the traveler still escapes and wanders the ship's corridors to cause damage...TWICE!  The whole episode is repetitve, and fails to live up to any potential it had.  I suppose it's watchable one time, but it's a harsh blemish on such a terrific season.  (5.5 / 10)------------------------------28) The City On The Edge Of Forever---This episode is routinely called the greatest of \"Star Trek\", and I can't blame them.  This is one of the most creative, inventive, and dramatic stories from this Original Series.  It's bit chaotic at first: Dr. McCoy is accidentally drugged to the point of madness, and he escapes to a nearby planet with a time-traveling portal.  When he jumps through, the Enterprise realizes that he somehow changed history.  They all agree to jump in, and try to stop McCoy from altering history.  Kirk and Spock arrive in the Great Depression, and while they try to use 20th century technology to research the point where McCoy changed history, Kirk falls in love with a marvelous woman.  Edith Keeler runs a mission, takes in Kirk & Spock out of kindness, and pays them to work so that they can buy supplies for their own purposes.  To me, this episode has one too many coincidences: How in the world can Kirk & Spock be absolutely sure that Dr. McCoy is going to arrive at their point in time?  But the strong acting and moving story make it all work, with special thanks to Joan Collins as the warm-hearted visionary who reaches Kirk's heart like nobody else had before.  This episode is truly a classic among classics, and has earned its reputation as one of the \"Star Trek\" greats.  (9.5 / 10)------------------------------29) Operation: Annihilate!---We now know that the \"Space Seed\" episode was the genesis (no pun intended) for the 2nd \"Star Trek\" movie, but at the time, this season finale was the first episode that felt like there could be long-term consequences from a given episode.  A colony's citizens have been going insane.  Their nervous systems are shutting down.  Kirk's brother's family are on this very planet.  And one of his closest officers is viciously attacked by the parasites that have infested the colony, possibly with permenant damage.  The stakes feel greater than ever, because every waking moment shows Kirk, Spock, and McCoy dealing with the possible death of millions of people.  Although this episode isn't one of the season's very best, it's still a very solid way to go off the air for a while.

I believe it's a big reason I'm in the computer industry today.Well getting on to the review.  I recently picked up a PS3 to use as a blu ray player and gaming console.  My first TV episode blu ray purchase was Star Trek:  The Original Series - Season 1.  On a big screen TV these episodes look simply amazing.  I have an Apple TV and have downloaded the remastered episodes from Apple and these look noticably better to me.  Like other reviewers said, the colors and picture quality is amazing.  I started out with one of my favorite episodes \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\".  This looks better than any movie I've seen from the 60's and 70's.  It's a great but tragic story too.  Sally Kellerman and Gary Lockwood are excellent guest stars.  I wish they would have figured out a way to bring them back in other episodes or movies.The Billy Blackburn home movies are a hoot.  It's really great to see the behind the scenes stuff.  You'll notice that Leonard Nimoy is deadly serious most of the time even when off camera.  Blackburn says he rarely got out of character.  Plus there is some other surprises with Blackburn that I won't spoil.If you're a SciFi lover or just a lover of good writing and television.  I would add this to your collection without hesitation.

The set also comes with funky retro packaging that would make any self-respecting geek drool in a way that will insure their being single until the next season of Star Trek is released (giving them more time to enjoy this collection).  Sadly, Paramount is squeezing us Trekkies/Trekkers/Addicts like members of the mob would squeeze an inner-city grocery-store, with their outrageous prices.  $85.00 AFTER a 35% discount?  Ironic, being that in the show they're selling, money is no longer used.  Another thing that's bugged me in ALL the Trek DVD sets is the horrendous chapter break that happens after opening credits.  It jumps you about five minutes into the actual episode.  There is no way to skip the credit sequence, without missing a good chunk of the show.  Sure, it's fun the first 135 you narrate along with Captain Kirk talking about the Final Frontier, but it gets old by the 140th session, unless you really start adding variety by sucking in a balloon full of helium before speaking the words William ... Shatner ... reads ... with ... such ... high ... melodrama.  The picture quality is decent.  Probably not what you'd expect for the price.  Paramount didn't send in a restoration team to make this look as pretty as something released today should.  You know something wasn't done right with this set when these shows from the 60s look WORSE than Chaplin movies from the 20s do, in the Chaplin Collection (now THAT'S restoration).  What makes this worth the purchase are the compelling stories, great chemistry between the cast, nifty mini-skirts, cheesy alien outfits and finally getting to own the original episodes on DVD.  Is that worth $85.00, when you can still watch any of these shows for free on television?  It's your call.  At these prices, I've only purchased season 3, 4 and 5 of The Next Generation and this set of The Original Series.  I've rented each season of Deep Space Nine (at a more reasonable price, I would have bought them) and stopped, pointed and laughed wildly at the first three seasons of Voyager, whenever I pass them in the store.  You make the call and make sure you make the right one, because the execs at Paramount would just assume stomp a Tribble with bare feet than they would issue you a refund because you feel ripped-off, after opening the set and realizing you're basically getting a sort of washed-out collection of episodes in neat packaging and nothing more (the extras are weak).5 stars for the shows.  2 stars for the value.  3 stars overall.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the quality of episode?", "id": "1c0b640e18be5356c9390a8c47a50fa4", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B0002JJBZY", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I have been waiting for this product and this is my first and last purchase for the legindary series.

Van Helsing of course is the vampire-hunter from the novel Dracula.  Wrong, Van Helsing was a professor:  \"who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world...  He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has... an absolutely open mind... for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy.\" (pg 147-8, Penguin Books, 1993).  Van Helsing is a character invented to be a vessel of both science and compassion, truly multi-faceted, inhabiting the realms of heart and mind equally.  In the novel Dracula he is the voice of misreason and reason, hard answers and soft words, and bridges the world between Victorian humanism and Gothic mysticism.In the movie Van Helsing, he is none of these things.  He's a guy in a big hat, overcoat, boots, grisly face, kills monsters, and has no depth whatsoever.  I imagine most people will call this the film taking liberties for name-sake only, and as such, does not invite a true comparison with the original Van Helsing.  Whatever, I'm trying to defend one of the truly memorable characters in living literature.The characters around him latch onto this atmosphere of superficiality and voila, we have movie.You'll probably hear a lot of reviewers giving it five bloody stars, talking about how Stephen Sommers wanted to homage the classic B-movies of old; the endless Dracula movies, the Horror of Frankenstein, the Curse of the Mummies, the Ride of the Zombies, etc etc etc.  The problem with homaging these movies are that they are crap to begin with, and any homage has to find some kind of formula in them to mimic.  The only formula here, folks, is the studio's desire to make big money off of a crappy film.So go ahead and buy the DVD.  Buy it just to see if you'll end up repeating what I was saying a few months ago.  Why do we allow the film industry to inflict these wastes of time on us?  I wouldn't have a problem with this film if it wasn't such a blatant attempt to simply make money.Update, Sept. 10: 1 out of 4 people like the review.

Well the movie is big and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.First of all let me say that I have never read the Illiad. I have read the Odyessey and I enjoyed it a lot. From what I've been told of people the movie is not very acurate at all. However, I did enjoy it despite it's flaws in the story.I think by now everybody has heard the plot to the movie. Paris(Bloom) runs off with Helen(Kruger) because they are in love and she no longer wants to stay with her husband Menelaus the King of Sparta. Agnaemenon the head King of Greece looks at this as a chance to strike against the one kingdom that can face up to him in Troy.War is set and the Greeks must get the greatest warrior to fight for them. They get Achilles(Pitt)to fight for them. Agnaemenon is weary of this because Achilles doesn't worship him like the rest do, but he knows he needs him to win. They then sail off to Troy to get Helen and to conquer them.The city of Troy is not scared. King Priam(O'Toole) is not worried at all because of the high walls around his city, the sun god Apollo, and most of all because of his son Hector(Bana). The stage for the epic war is set and the battle is on.First of all let me say that I loved Brad Pitt in the movie. A lot of the critics have hammered him saying he didn't display the vainess and godlike qualities that Achillies displayed in the book. They must not have watched the same movie as I did. This was the most cocky and arrogant character Pitt has played to date. His vanity is incredible in the film. He also bulked up real big. He put on over 20lbs and he's cut to the bone.Eric Bana was great at Hector. Like Pitt he really bulked up as well. He does the best acting job in the film. He displays Hectors emotions perfectly. When he's going to fight Achillies he really does look like he knows he's the lamb going to the slaughter. His acting is superb and his performance is just awesome. He won't win an acadamey award, but you will enjoy it.Hector and Achillies are the two main characters in the film. The whole movie really does focus on the battle between the two of them and how much there respective people await on them.The sets in the movie are fantastic. They did a great job building the city of Troy. Everything looks authentic to the time period. It's about the only thing that is accurate to it's time.Like I said the movie is not accurate to Homers poem at all. It is however a great action film. If you look past those flaws and don't spend your time ripping the movie for it's flaws you really wil enjoy a well made action film.

So the main leaders of the Third Reich; Adolph Hitler, Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbel along with his wife and children, and various employees and military leaders hide in a bunker to avoid capture from the Russians.

These 2 films are playing in every multiplex in hell along with &quot;Signs&quot;, & &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot;, with a complimentary helping of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; thrown in for good measure (now THAT'S scary!). &quot;The Village&quot; is a scary movie that is made for women (its the type of scary movie that won't induce nightmares. In other words, its NOT scary) & looks like it was filmed on location at the local &quot;Pottery Barn&quot;.&quot;Covington Woods&quot; is home to a small village of peaceful people who have a small problem. They can't leave their village due to &quot;creatures&quot; living in the woods that surround the boundaries beyond the village. When the villagers first settled down into their new home, they made a pact with the &quot;creatures&quot; along the lines of, you leave us alone, we will leave you alone. &quot;The creatures&quot; have other ideas sneaking into the village at night leaving behind dead, mangled, & hairless chihuahuas about the grounds & scaring the villagers witless. When a stabbing occurs, that could prove fatal if not without the proper medication, a young blind girl, who isn't afraid of &quot;the creatures&quot;, is sent to the village across the way to get the proper medication that can heal her future husband.As I watched &quot;The Village&quot;, with roughly 30 other people in the theater, I couldn't believe how bad this film was. The only comedy relief that came throughout the film was when one of my fellow moviegoers promptly stood up during a slow point in the film, declared that this movie, quote - unquote, blows, and then left the theater. What suprised me was that not one of the 29 other people, myself included, didn't disagree with him!The movie is a bit of a bore. I do give credit for some great cinematography but thats it. The cast is lame. Everyone walks thru their roles. Sigourney Weaver is wasted in her role (I was waiting for her to cowboy up, slap her idiot son in the back of the head, and go kill &quot;the creatures&quot; herself). William Hurt reads his lines as if their on cue cards. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's on some bad valium trip (his character is reminiscent of the Mel Gibson character from &quot;Signs&quot;. Phoenix even looks like a bit like Gibson in some shots).&quot;The creature&quot; is absolutely laughable, being a cross between a pig, & a porcupine with a red riding hood complex (Frank, the bunny from &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, is more scarier, for God's Sake!). I would be more scared if a car full of clowns showed up in the middle of the woods, than this &quot;creature&quot; chasing me.The so called &quot;gotcha&quot; surprise that happens in every one of Shyamalan's films usually suck. This one is no surprise (when the surprise is revealed, I couldn't help but think if these people missed watching the Democratic Convention and hugging a tree everyday. Maybe they still hug trees, but their was no hugging of trees on screen).Shyamalan's main downfall is that he always has the sense & style to create a suspenseful film but when it comes to the payoff, or the moneyshot he can never deliver (&quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is the golden exception). Also, the main problem with Shyamalan's film is, after the release of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; & with every Shyamalan film there after, audiences know something is going to happen during the final act of the film, so they keep their eyes open for every little detail available thruout the course of the film.&quot;Time&quot; magazine was once quoted as saying that M.

The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace. In addition, anyone is fair game no matter how guilty or innocent. One of the shockers in The Ring is the false conclusion where we find out that what we thought put the ghost at peace had no effect at all other than to solve the mystery of how the girl died.The demons are also very Eastern: not the ugly, leering Christian demons from hell but ones that are unsettling and watchful. More portents of distruction than bringers.I actually appreciated the restraint with CGI and gore after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning just the night before. Although the thinking behind films these days seems to be that the audience expects lots of gore and special effects (otherwise they won't pay to see the film), I think the over-the-top approach usually detracts from the story as was the case in Exorcist I (which had potential but ended up being an abortion of a movie).The non-linear approach to telling the story didn't bother me; in fact I enjoyed it because it sustained the mystery. In another inevitable comparison to The Ring, I think The Grudge, is far more satisfying it it's explaination for why the vengeful ghost and why the seemling indiscriminate selection of victims.One more plus, the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu were a lot more enlightening than the typical gushing sound bites you find on most DVDs. They seemed to have left the over the top superlatives to the American performers.The movie has some weaknesses which is why I gave it only three stars.First, the pacing seems glacial: there aren't many extreme emotional events for the first 30 minutes. Even events that seem like they should be disturbing, left me feeling \"why should I care?\" Because Sam Raimi (\"Evil Dead\" and \"Spiderman\") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision. For me, it didn't work.Second, the lead played by Sarah Michelle Geller, seemed to be not much more than a one-dimensional vehicle for keeping the story moving. If you're expecting Buffy kicking demon ass, you'll need to look at reruns or DVD compilations. Buffy is no where to be found in this movie.Bottom line: I recommend this movie IF you are open to the fact that it is a Japanese ghost story and with the exception of casting American actors, does little to Westernize the film.

It's based on a Broadway play written by Patrick Marber, who also wrote the screenplay. And the writing is atrocious. This is a \"relationship movie\". It's about two couples: Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a young American in London. She and Dan (Jude Law) meet when Alice looks the wrong way when crossing a street and is hit by a car. After he has been with Alice for a year, Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a portrait photographer who is also American. Anna rejects him. So Dan poses as Anna on an internet sex chat site and sets Anna up with Larry (Clive Owen), a sleazebag doctor, without her knowing it. But Anna and Larry hit it off and become a couple. A year later, Dan is still with Alice but preoccupied with Anna. So change your partners, dosey-doe. But that's not the end of it. Unfortunately.The first thing that I noticed about \"Closer\" is that it's contrived to the point of being corny. The second thing I noticed is that I didn't know anyone's name. The characters have protracted conversations with strangers without introducing themselves. We get the first name 10 minutes into the film. By this point, it's a relief. I presume \"Closer\" is supposed to be about how and why people love one another, but it is a hypothetical exploration of that subject. Real people don't act or speak like these characters, and there is no indication of why the characters care for one another. In fact, they really don't seem to. The idea that any of the characters are in love is preposterous.The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. It feels like a play. A bad play. Characters constantly make nonsensical proclamations, like \"I couldn't lie to you....because I love you.\" Every conversation is ponderous. The writing is so bad that sometimes one character has to articulate what another is feeling. Larry is a thoroughly obnoxious person who lives for conquest. Dan is a romantic. Both men are uncommonly self-absorbed. Anna is guilt-ridden. Alice is supposed to be an enigma, but she's just childlike. Anna and Larry both seem emotionally ill, so I have to agree with Larry that they belong together. All four of them have a pathological desire to know everything about their partners, which they spend most of their time pursuing. At one point Dan says, \"Please tell me the truth....because I'm addicted to it.\" Yup. Their lives would be a lot easier if these people discovered the concept of discretion.I can't say \"Closer\" is all bad. It really depends upon your sense of humor. The dialogue is unintentionally funny from the start. If you last long enough, there is one interminable conversation between Larry and Alice in a strip club that is absolutely hilarious. You'll laugh out loud when Dan breaks down in tears. That's notable for being the nadir of Jude Law's career. Truthfully, Clive Owen's performance is good, but his character is nonsense. The other three performances are flat. They could scarcely be otherwise. So I don't recommend the film. But if you approach \"Closer\" with wry humor and lots of popcorn, you might find something in it.The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005 release): There is a music video for \"The Blower's Daughter\", performed by Damien Rice, which is the song that plays over the closing credits.

But it is quite a watchable movie, if only for the brilliant star power of its four main and only characters: Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Julie Roberts and Clive Owen. Owen, being the least well-known of the four, nevertheless manages to deliver the strongest performance, or has the best lines, in Mike Nichols' adaptation of Patrick Marber's play. But my favorite is Natalie Portman as Alice. She is beautiful and  sensational in this film, representing  - if I may speculate - Innocent Love. Her character is there to show how we can tragically screw up Innocent or True Love. And who hasn't? The other three characters in the story are busy hurting each other and essentially form a love triangle with Anna (Roberts) as the confused, sought-after prize. While Alice is the most innocent of the four she delivers the hardest and most honest blow at the end. She is really the only character to admire of the lot. I have been a devoted fan of Natalie Portman ever since BEAUTIFUL GIRLS and she doesn't disappont in  CLOSER. Basically a downer film, CLOSER nevertheless has some fine performances and the script is sound. The problem is that one is left questioning why four near-middle-aged, attractive, successful people willingly engage in such screwed-up, hurtful, juvenile relationships. One wonders if such a script got made into a movie due to Hollywood Myopia. That would explain in general why box office receipts have been falling off: Hollywood produces way too many movies like CLOSER which seemed targeted for a certain group of intellectual elite who think it chic to get depressed while being entertained; yet these kind of movies are artistically representative of the lives of only a fraction of ticket-buyers and are likely based on the writer's dysfunctional friends and relatives.

The songs are fantastic and the story is consistently enthralling.  Gerald Butler makes a compelling Phantom, successfully combining both the menace and the pathos of the character.  Patrick Wilson makes a dashing Raoul.  The real star of the show is Emmy Rossum as Christine.  This kind of breakout performance is once-in-a-bluemoon event.  Why wasn't she nominated for an Oscar?  For that matter why didn't she sing the nominated song at the Oscars instead of Beyonce?  Rossum combines an expressiveness that combines innocence and sensuality.

Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect.  She was born to play this role, and it will follow her the rest of her life.  Not a bad thing.  I wish she had been playing the lead the last time I saw Phantom on stage.Patrick Wilson has a nice voice, and he was good enough in the role of Raoul, which is a fairly flat role to begin with.  However, the role can be played with greatness, and I would have liked to see the Broadway Raoul Jim Weitzer in this role, for he is fantastic.  I saw him when he was merely an understudy on the traveling tour, and he gives his Raoul life beyond the script.  Oh, well.  It's Christine's story, and Wilson is likeable enough to be believed.The music, with one exception, is spectacular, actually an improvement over the original 80's score.  The orchestrations are bigger and the sound is more modern, and yet perfectly authentic to the original.The story, with one exception, is almost word-for-word the same as the stage play, and being without the restraints of the stage leaves the filmmakers able to cut between scenes and do things a play simply can't do.  Visually the film is beautiful, full of the bright colors and glorious eye candy that those who have seen the play will expect.  There was even a moment during the opening scene, when the chandelier rose and the color splashed onto the screen and that magnificent score began, when I almost felt I was watching the play again.Minnie Driver as Carlotta is a scene-stealer, to say the least, and one of the best things about the film.  This was one instance in which the filmmakers got it right.But unfortunately they got one thing wrong, and that is Gerard Butler.  Although I have no complaints about Butler himself - he did a fine job, even a remarkable job in places - but he is simply too young and too handsome for the role, and while his voice is good, it is not nearly good enough.  He simply did not belong in this role.  The distorted face under the mask was disappointing too, as if the producers didn't want to mar his handsomeness by making him too scarred and ugly.  But scarred and ugly is the whole point.  The stage Phantom I saw the first time (Brad Little, who was brilliant) had an unforgettably gruesome face.  Butler's face looked like a mild case of acne in comparison, certainly not a face that would drive a person into madness and seclusion.  They missed by a long shot on that one.Nevertheless, I very much liked Butler's portrayal (it's not his fault, after all, that's he's young, handsome, and doesn't have a fantastic voice), especially during the Don Juan Triumphant scene.Overall I am very pleased with this movie, and I would highly recommend it to those who are unable to see it on stage.

I dont really like musicals but this I kind of liked. I never heard the original singers or anything so I didnt find anything wrong with the singing other than some of the style is not really my type.Anyway, lets start off with what I do like. The movie is visually stunning. I love the sets and stuff. The beginning I thought was great! It draws you in nice and easy building mystery around the opera house and the Phantom. The music is nice, the story is building. What I really like is when Christine is in her room and the candles blow out and you hear the booming voice of the Phantom in the shadows and finally appears in the mirror and leads Christine down a secret passage down into depths of the opera house. The song here is great, the visuals are stunning, you can feel that the Phantom and Christine have this romantic vibe going on. I loved the movie at this point.UNFORTUNATLY...After this Christine removes the Phantoms mask and he flips out. Christine leaves and then SUDDENLY falls for a childhood friend. Well the love between them doesnt feel very real nor is there any fire going on that you feel when she was with the Phantom earlier. This is where things start to slide I think. The music becomes redundant and none of the songs after the main theme song, \"Phantom of the Opera\" which was sung during the desent to the Phantoms lair, are as good or feel as awesome. Christine and the Phantoms romance is never there again after she takes off the mask. The Phantom feels more like a creepy stalker than a sympathetic person. The movie drags on for too long and the mystery and intreague that was there in the beginning is completely gone. The ending is not tragic at all because you feel nothing for the Phantom like you are supposed to. Had there still felt like a romantic connection was still there between Christine and the Phantom, the ending would have felt alot more tragic and you would feel a little more for the Phantom as he wouldnt seen as just an evil obsessed stalker.Anyway, I recommend the film cause I think you should watch it at least once. I hear the problems that I have with the movie are not there in the stage version as there is more mystery throught the story and you feel more of a connection between the Phantom and Christine. I dont know what the core problem of WHY the movie didnt work out as well as the stage play but I can deffenatly feel something is missing and left me disappointed in the end.

Better still, this one I can see a couple more times without being out $60 a pop!POTO (Phantom Of the Opera) has always gotten mixed reviews. It lacks the snob appeal that attracts the kind of people who usually enjoy staged musicals and operas, so right off, a big part of the core audience turns up its nose.  This show is really more for the average person, someone who likes tunes that haunt the mind, a sexy story, and a bit of a thrill, and who is willing to let down the hypercritical guard and just enjoy the ride.Emily Rossum's voice is quite stunning - the role requires an incredible range, and she not only had that, but she was able to go from this floaty, ingenue voice to a throaty seductress.  I was a little put off by the way they lit her up so she kind of glowed in the dark in one scene - this girl is so pretty on her own I don't think she needs the help.I thought Gerard Butler, the guy who played Phantom, was an excellent choice.  I had hoped they'd get this made sooner so Crawford could do it, but at 62, much as I love the guy's voice and his rendering of this character, he's not right for the part anymore.  Phantom should be much older than Christine, but not three times her age.  At thirty-something, Butler's Phantom is old enough to be her father, which works with her mindset, but still young enough to be a possible romantic interest.  What drives the tragic aspect of this is that there is the possibility of a romance, there is that spark of attraction, but it's always just out of his reach.  Butler's voice isn't nearly as nice as Michael Crawford's, but he made up for it in other ways. With the mask and wig, this guy is so gorgeous that you gotta wonder what red-blooded woman could possibly prefer Raoul to him (and Raoul is pretty appealing!). And Butler brought some nuances to the part that I liked.  His portrayal is darker, and you see a little more of the madness, which helps the viewer to understand Christine's choices.I liked this Raoul a lot better too.  I can't put my finger on what's different this time, but it seems like Wilson's version is more fully developed, more substantial.  In the stage show Raoul seemed pretty shallow, and thus I kind of disliked Christine for falling for him so quickly.  And this guy's voice is just awesome!Also Minnie Driver simply steals the show as the Prima Donna - I don't recall liking the stage versions as much either. She is the only person whose voice is dubbed - the real singer, Margaret Preece, has a brief appearance in one of the Operas.There is one legitimate grumble about this show.  The script has some major weak points, places where, without giving anything away, it's hard to understand what the good guys are thinking walking into an obvious trap.  This happens at such a central part of the show that it kind of distracts from the tension, which is why I knocked off one star.  But by that time I'm usually so caught up in the seduction of it that I'm way past caring.It boils down to this: If you love the music, the story, and the whole Phantom romance thing, you won't care. If you aren't enthralled by these things, then the faults will probably bother you.", "qas": [{"question": "Why the rest of the cast is uniformly fine?", "id": "beeef1b7bfdf921f9573301dc97393be", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "My mom always loved the music to The Phantom of the Opera, but I wasn't officially introduced to it until I was twelve (when it first came out). My world geography teacher had seen it and loved it so much, he decided to dedicate a week of class listening to the soundtrack and going over the story. At the end of the week, he assigned extra credit to anyone who went to see it over the weekend. I was already determined to see it because I was intrigued by the storyline and mesmerized by the music.Eight years later and it still remains one of my top three favorite movies of all time. I've seen the play on Broadway since then and have read my fair share of Phantom 'fan fiction'. The movie is pretty different from seeing it live on stage, but I've found over time that the beauty of the story lies in its ability to adapt in one's interpretaton of it. Some people like a crazy Phantom, while others prefer a softer portrayal of the masked anti-hero. Sometimes Christine is dreadfully afraid of the Phantom and in other adaptations she's in love with him.I think part of why this particular story has been retold so many times throughout the years and loved by so many is that everyone has the flexibility to see what they want to see.The Phantom of the Opera is about a young chorus girl named Christie who is receiving private voice lessons from a mysterious Angel of Music. She believes the Angel is the spirit of her dead father because he promised on his deathbed he would send her the Angel for protection, comfort, and tutelage when he passed on. Little does she know, the Angel is in fact the infamous Opera Ghost who frequently terrorizes those who don't follow his commands. He contacts her from behind her dressing room mirror, reluctant to reveal his true identity for fear Christine will shun him. He is deeply obsessed with her and eagerly awaits the day he can present himself to her as a man.The story begins when the old manager of the opera house decides to retire. The new managers, Firmin and Andre, don't buy into the stories of the Opera Ghost and refuse to be ordered around by an invisible specter. In addition to new management, the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny has become the opera's new patron. Christine and Raoul instantly recognize one another as childhood sweethearts, and rekindle their relationship. Despite the Phantom's efforts to seduce Christine with his music, she and Raoul fall deeply in love. This only manages to make matters worse. Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom become tangled in a web of passion, jealousy, obsession, and darkness.First and foremost, the music is simply divine and stays with me for weeks at a time upon listening. There is something hypnotic, exhilerating, and majestic about it. It captures the essence of melodrama and Gothic romance perfectly. I love everyone's voices, indlucing Gerard Butler's. He may not be a conventional Phantom, but I really enjoyed the rich, sensual, passionate sound of his voice in contrast to Raoul's sweet, soft one. I'm not really sure how this movie didn't win more awards for costume and design because the costumes and sets are lush, sumptuous, and grand in scale.This adaptation of the musical emphasizes on the relationship between the Phantom and Christine. Instead of being overwhelmed by her fear of him, Christine is portrayed as having a deeper, more soulful connection with the Phantom. She is in love with Raoul, but there is a side of her that responds to the Phantom's advances. Even though Gerard Butler plays more of a sexy Phantom, I think he understood the role well enough to bring the power and force required to fulfill the role. He starts out as seductive and passionate, and eventually progresses to a raging, broken shell of a man with deep insecurities. I like that despite his appealing physical qualities, he managed to stay true to the Phantom's volatile emotional core.Emmy Rossum is perfect as the naive and gentle Christine who is struggling to come to terms with her father's death. Patrick Wilson is not always the most expressive actor, but he has some shining moments throughout the film and has the perfect singing voice for Raoul. Minnie Driver was entertaining as Carlotta, the spoiled and selfish Prima Donna of the Opera Populaire.

In some ways, this film did wonderful justice to the famous stage show. In others, it could have done better.The LOOK of the film was fabulous, absolutely gorgeous beyond description. The costuming, the sets, all of it was beautiful. I was glad they kept the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the Phantom's mask, only covering HALF the face, rather than the whole thing. But I was surprised at how non-repulsive the Phantom actually WAS. He's supposed to have these ghastly hideous features, but he really wasn't that bad, his scars were minor and not monstrous at all. It was a little anti-climactic. The Phantom himself was a little too attractive, too sexy, which was a little weird.I don't mind so much that Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford did not play in this film. However, I think that the voices they had were not as good as they could have found. The Phantom had a decent voice, but it wasn't dark like it should have been. Christine seemed to have some trouble reaching some of the higher notes, and her voice was simply too weak to be convincing as an opera singer. It was a nice voice, sweet and pretty, but unsupported, a voice that would never carry in an opera house. And while I didn't necessarily mind Minnie Driver's role as the prima donna, it didn't make any sense to have her play the part in the first place --- especially since she didn't even do her own singing. This is a popular enough show that it doesn't NEED a big name just for the sake of having a big name in the film. That almost seems to show a lack of faith in their own work, if they have to feature someone well-known to get people interested in seeing it. They should have used the person who actually did the singing voice.At least most of the music was in there. I was worried they would cut a lot of the good songs, but they kept it all in there, and most of it was pretty well-done, even if the voices COULD have been stronger.The most annoying thing for me, though, was the random flashes into the \"present,\" the black-and-white segments. The beginning and the end is fine, it's appropriate. But having them interspersed through the rest of the film was really distracting, and unnecessary. It brought the audience out of the real action of the story and didn't add anything to the plot. Didn't make sense.I certainly enjoyed the film, and it had a lot of good things about it.

Never mind that most other series never last longer than five years, or that the Simpsons are still on the air over 10 years later. The first five seasons are funny. Season six is hilarious.I could go through the episode list, but you can read adequate iterations of that here already. Besides, these are rerun frequently through Fox syndication. Any Simpsons fan knows these shows by heart.Sideshow Bob is highlighted in one, Maggie in another, and Mr. Burns has plenty to deal with when he gets shot. Itchy and Scratchy's theme park goes awry, Patty and Selma hook up Homer with a loan, and even Santa's Little Helper gets into action. It is no longer a show that focuses on Homer and Bart. Instead, the writers stretch into new areas and ideas that grant the Simpsons great staying power.Two songs are worth noting, \"Jazzman\" and \"The Stonecutter's Song.\"When Bleeding Gums, Lisa's jazz mentor, passes away, they sing \"Jazzman\" beautifully. It is a sad episode that is surprisingly inspring.In the episode when Homer joins a secret society, \"The Stonecutter's Song,\" is fantastically funny as most of Springfield's male adults grab their beers and sing in chorus:\"Stonecutters: Who controls the British crown?Who keeps the metric system down?We do! We do!\"These are the episodes when the Simpsons show development as characters. Six years into the series, they have history, complicated storylines and maturity. They are nuanced, with personalities more complex that what might be expected in a cartoon. It is no longer just a rebellious, edgy show, but becoming quickly part of Americana that now crosses two generations.Extras? The usual. The most important extra is what you'll regularly enjoy, the completeness of these complete episodes. No commercials, and entire episodes.

Crash is a film designed to talk about racism, or, rather, to bring racism up, shove our faces in it, and force *us* to talk about it. And it does that very well.Crash brings together characters of different backgrounds and ethnicities whose lives only briefly intersect; usually, when they do, they react to one another based on the most easily noticable differences--race. The movie is well-acted, well-written and well-directed. You might think that--well, it's about racism, so I know that it's going to be straight-forward and present racists as evil and the oppressed as heroic, etc. But, it's not so. Crash has a great deal more sophistication than that, as displayed in the very opening scene where two young black males are complaining how people act afraid of them just because they're young black males... just before they carjack a passing couple. Surprises abound in this movie, and everyone is shown to have virtues and flaws.I've noted that some earlier reviewers complain of the \"preachiness\" of the film, but I can't disagree more. Crash doesn't tell us what to do--it doesn't tell us who is right, who wrong, or even why.

It's actually scary, the gore is gut-wrenching, the setting is great, and the creature designs are great. If you love horror movies, you need to watch this movie because it's the best horror movie made in over a decade.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Six women; Sarah, Juno, Beth, Rebecca, Holly, and Sam; go on a cave-climbing trip in the Appalachian Mountains, and find a mysterious cave no one has been in for over a century and wish to claim it and name it... or at least Juno does. The rest of the group thinks they're going to Borham Caverns. Things seem to be going well for a while, until the cave entrance collapses, and now they are trapped two miles underground with grotesque human-like creatures who like the taste of flesh.STORYLINE: SCORE: 8 OUT OF 10- Some parts of the story evoke memories of storylines that would come from a movie in the '80s, or perhaps earlier. However, the story is done well, although the beginning is slow, and it never gives an explanation as to what those creatures are, or an explanation of the bizarre and creepy ending. But that will never really bother you.MUSIC: SCORE: 9 OUT OF 10- There's not much, but it's good, and it knows when the pivotal moments of terror in the film come up.GORE FACTOR: SCORE: 9.75 OUT OF 10- The gore is just plain nasty and nausea-inducing. Eye-squishing, rock-climbing-axe-stabbing, falling into giant pools of blood, broken leg, and people being eaten... lovely.SCARE FACTOR: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- Don't watch this movie in the dark, it will scare the hell out of you. The film is tense a lot as you fear what comes next, and you don't know what comes next. It's really a marvel to see a film that still has an ability to scare you.ENTERTAINMENT: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- Aside from a slow beginning, this film has the perfect entertainment for horror fans and will definitely satisfy those who are looking for something that is actually scary and worth watching as a horror movie. Don't watch this movie if you're afraid of the dark or you're claustrophobic because it is loaded with these fears.OVERALL: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- This film is incredible and rather impressive, as it puts so many other horror movies to shame.

This film is far, far better (and has more surprises) than some of the lackluster flicks like \"Hills Have Eyes\", and \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\". The man who directed it Neil Marshall hasn't directed a film in three years prior to this but, he showed no rust here.One thing that does stand out this flick from the other garbage (When A Stranger Calls another trash flick) is the fact that this is an all female cast. Think about that for a sec, there haven't been that many horror flicks with all female cast, well at least ones that haven't been this good.Reading some of Neil Marshall's interview on the film and his directing is also interesting. While he had planned to make the movie after \"Dog Soldiers\", nothing really happened. That might actually have been a good thing because he describes working through several drafts of the movie.  Having gone through so many, it's conceivable that the first draft may not have been developed as the product fans have seen.The great thing about this movie that sets apart the other garbage released this year is the fact that the characters in the movie are all sympathetic and well rounded. We give a crap about them. That's a key thing that many directors even the big ones miss many times.Shauna MacDonald and Natalie Mendoza who plays Sarah and Juno are absolute fantastic.  Natalie has acted in tv shows and movies, but this probably her leading role to date and she really carries this flick along with her co-stars. The story about the girls on a caving expedition is very simple, but once you see the terror that they deal with, both the creatures and terrain they are on, you see it's a very complicated script.As far as the endings for the flick, well I don't see them as a big deal. I figured out how things were going to turn after the accidental death of one of the girls. I wasn't disappointed at all in this flick.

HALLOWEEN. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The list is lengthy. Some of them introduce new characters that send goose bumps up our backs. Others tread over old material and put a fresh spin on them. But THE DESCENT doesn't do any of that.Comically labeled as \"Six Chicks With Picks,\" this cave exploration thriller has the obligatory fright scenes (you know the kind ...where something weird suddenly and loudly burst toward screen), the attractive die-off cast, and themes trodden over time and again (from ALIENS to the horrible film THE CAVE.)For some reason this flick has gotten several positive reviews by professional film critics, but I fail to see why. There's nothing original. Nothing that lingers after watching it. No truly memorable cast members.That we're supposed to sympathize with Sarah (Shauna Mcdonald), the main character, is rammed down our throats (and through her husband's head) when a car accident takes Sarah's family from her. A year later, a group of girlfriends get together to go spelunking and to try and heal the wounds left by the death of Sarah's husband and child. There's a touch of deceit going on as Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) was obviously having an affair with Sarah's husband before the accident. Whether Sarah knows of this or not is up for interpretation.As the group of six descend into the cave we quickly learn that this is an unexplored hole. And when a cave-in happens, they're forced to find another way out. But with them in the caverns is something pale and insidious (think about the Morlocks from THE TIME MACHINE and you won't be far off). But are they really there? Is it possible that Sarah's had a meltdown and only imagined seeing these creatures?It isn't the question of Sarah's sanity that'll put you off The Descent, but rather the ho-hum attitude most will have after seeing the film. It just doesn't have any emotional impact. You don't care whether these gals live or get their stomachs ripped open.The filming is also very dark and it's often difficult to see what exactly is going on. Although caves are dark and difficult to see in, this doesn't necessarily translate well to an entertaining movie experience.Still, those with a fear of enclosed spaces will probably be pretty freaked out by The Descent.

The film opens with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith in marriage counseling, and apparently, the magic has gone out of their marriage, probably because they can't speak truthfully about their jobs. They don't know that they are both skilled assassins, but when they are hired to do a hit on each other, the truth unravels. The plot is rather brainless, but I realized about ten minutes into the movie that I really didn't care.The first part of the film is more enjoyable and successful than the second part, mainly because it's fun to watch the Smiths not realize the truth about each other and then dance on eggshells around each other when they think they know the truth. The dialogue is witty, and filled with great one-liners and double entendres. Take, for example, when John and Jane return home for dinner after trying to kill each other, and John says, in response to Jane's question of why he has returned early from his so-called business trip, \"I missed you.\" She replies, matter-of-factly, \"I missed you, too.\" The movie is often very funny, although most laughs come from when they're doing generic couple stuff (like seeing a counselor, eating dinner at home, brushing their teeth, etc.).\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" relies mostly on the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie, and they have that in spades. The sex appeal literally explodes off the screen, and I wish the film spent more time laboring over the couple-stuff they do and not so much the explosions and action. Jolie has never looked better or more hypnotically beautiful than in this movie, and it's pretty obvious why Pitt's character falls for her almost instantly. I also thought that Jolie was great at making her Jane Smith character a real person; she brings a quiet poignancy to the role. As John Smith, Pitt is wickedly funny and excellent. He gets all the best lines. In the hands of a lesser actor, his lines would sometimes seem corny, but Pitt makes his character believable and extremely likable. The supporting characters (played by Adam Brody, Kerry Washington, and Vince Vaughn) seem a bit wasted, but this is, after all, the Brad and Angelina show.My main problem with the film is the excessive (and often plodding) action scenes. While it is fun to watch Pitt and Jolie look sexy while doing cool stunts, it gets tiring pretty quickly. This is the primary reason that the last thirty minutes or so of the film aren't as witty or entertaining as the earlier moments in the film.

Serenity is a movie that uses genres as a foundation upon which to build a story about real people, who just happen to be vagabonds on a rusty old spaceship.The plot: Malcolm, captain of the space-ship Serenity and his crew are doing their usual gallivanting around in space, trying to eke out a living in a politically hostile environment, with one difference: their crew is temporarily supplemented by a young doctor (Simon) and his mentally unstable, but very telepathic, younger sister, River. Simon and River are fugitives from the afore-mentioned political hostility, embodied by a sword-wielding man known as \"the Operative\". The crew, the fugitives, the government, and a group of very evil secondary villains called Reavers, provide a magnificent cast of characters whose conflict (and other interactions, but mostly conflict) kept me spellbound for the entire movie.I've long been a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but Serenity is better than either.  Reflecting on the movie afterwards, I kept finding similarities to Star Trek: Voyager.  Both shows focus on a small ship and her rag-tag crew. The crews squabble a lot, but ultimately pull together for the common good.  However, I liked Serenity much more than I ever liked Voyager because it was so much more real and alive.  Star Trek has science fiction, and interesting characters.  Star Wars has this plus a nice background mythology and some realistic grittiness.  Serenity includes all of the above, plus humor, more grittiness, sex, theft, and really nasty bad guys.  The result is a realistic universe that people in this messed up world can relate to.In the last few years a lot of science fiction and fantasy movies have had two things:  lots of characters with British accents, and cheesy lines.  Serenity once again leaves its competitors in the dust by transcending all predictability by using fairly neutral, Chinese, and American accents, as well as a British accent from India.  Instead of cheesy lines, it goes for totally-unexpected-and-hilarious, such as: \"Been more'n a year since I had anything twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!\"  There is no denying that the language is odd, and it may take you a while to get used to it.  But stay with the language, because it's so worth listening to!  The odd terminology and turns of phrase drive home the fact that this is not just another sci-fi copy.(Spoiler alert!) A popular phrase in screen-writing these days is \"action that tells the story\". I first remember seeing this concept in The Bourne Identity. Serenity does an even better job because it has an even more interesting motivation for violence, and it juggles multiple action characters. If you've read anything about the history of Serenity you already know that River has some amazing skills. She is also a very attractive young woman. In an average movie, a young male viewer (such as myself) might be inclined to focus on the person on screen more than on her character. In this case, River's character is so incredibly fascinating that you can't help but focus on her character. She is complex, she invokes sympathy, and she has more dimensions than the average human, let alone movie character. Although Malcolm and his crew seem like the main characters of the movie, it is ultimately River who steals the show.  (End spoiler).I've always assumed that if you notice computer graphics in a movie, it is because they are badly done.  Serenity dashed this theory for me.  The three or four times I noticed effects elements, they didn't take center stage or in any way distract from the movie.  They simply communicated the necessary information to the audience and then got out of the way and let the story continue.  The shots of planets were extremely beautiful; an excellent counterpoint to other, more disturbing, images in the movie.As I mentioned before, Serenity has some elements that border on horror.  The filmmakers made an excellent decision when they decided to leave most of the disturbing imagery to the audience's imagination. The Reavers are a hideous and evil \"people\" whose presence could easily have been overplayed for shock value. But the film judiciously cuts around them, never showing more than a glimpse of their horrible faces. In place of these images are lines such as, \"You know he's better off dead than what the Reavers would have done to him.\" Once again, the movie is about the characters, rather than about something as superficial as Reaver make-up.I can only think of one negative thing to say about Serenity: There were a few times during big action scenes when two characters would hold an important (and usually emotional) conversation. Obviously, in terms of sound mixing, you have to turn the environmental sounds down so that you can hear the dialog, but I think they went too far.  Two or three times, the contrast of these suddenly quiet conversations broke the mood for me.On the other hand, there was another kind of mood change that I liked a lot. Being a mentally unstable psychic, River expresses a lot of her personality inside her own head. In the medium of film, it is easy to go inside someone's head, and Serenity does a marvelous job of it. I didn't grow up watching movies, so I have often found myself a little confused when movies do things like this. In Serenity it was always crystal clear to me, and the revelations brought by these psychic journeys helped connect the audience to River and her huge part in the story.Serenity is an excellent movie.  It might be a little confusing at first, but if you are a action movie fan or science-fiction fan at all, or if you just like great story-telling, you will like it.Note: For the few who don't know, Serenity is based on the TV series Firefly.  When I watched Serenity, I had never seen Firefly, but I still loved the movie!  Since then, I have watched most of the Firefly series.

Whedon doesn't disappoint fans with high expectations, but also gives enough background so that newcomers aren't totally lost. I think, however, there's much more depth for viewers of the series or who have seen the reruns on SciFi channel. There just isn't enough time to cover the relationships in a two hour movie. But the series is just that good--if you haven't seen it before the movie, I'll guarantee you will afterwards.One departure Whedon takes from other sci-fi shows is the ship and scenes are much more realistic and believable. Serenity is a cargo ship and looks like one. It's functional and not all shiny and clean like on Star Trek. The colonized towns look more like the old west, except for the hovercraft and six shooters that fire lasers. There's definitely a western feel to things with a little Asian thrown in. Frequently, the crew is given to swear in a Mandarin-sounding language which is a sweet way to keep the ratings and yet be believable. Some of the cities and even the Serenity sport Asian decor and writing.I find it interesting the Whedon is allegedly agnostic because he slips in a lot of religious themes. There's first and foremost Shepard Book, the preacher with the mysterious past, played wonderfully by Ron Glass in the series and who has way too short a role in the film. (Oldsters will remember that Glass played a detective in the comedy Barney Miller.) Inara, a companion, is a Buddhist. And Mr. Universe, a pirate broadcaster, has a Jewish wedding with his robot companion. (I, Robot anyone?) Even The Operative (played chillingly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) has his own twisted creed.Another theme of the movie (without giving anything away) is the harm done when the government mettles. In the series, two genius siblings become passengers. Simon, a doctor, smuggles his sister, River, who has been used as a guinea pig by the universal government known as the Alliance. She is a psychic and they have tried to tap into her brain. This has left her unstable and possibly dangerous even to her friends. Simon gave up his budding career to save her and now the Alliance wants her back so they put The Operative on Serenity's trail.Serenity is a roller coaster in a movie theater--it catapults you along. You'll laugh (a lot!), you'll cry and yes, you'll cheer. This is also a thinking person's sci-fi movie and it will give you a lot to ponder later. One hopes Whedon can work the same magic he was able to with Buffy and resurrect this movie back into a series.

After all, Serenity is the follow-up to a failed TV show from 2002 that lasted only 11 episodes on FOX.  Sure the DVD sales for the complete series of Firefly have been amazing, but that is no indicator of how a movie will do.  Yet, Universal Pictures took a chance and bought the movie rights from FOX.  Reassembling the original cast and creator, they made the hopes and dreams of Browncoats (Firefly fans) everywhere.  The series left many questions unanswered (supposedly, creator Joss Whedon planned out seven years of storylines for the show), and fans saw this movie as not only a way to get answers for their questions, but it was a way to revisit the Firefly universe and its beloved characters.  You see, it's not just the stories that made Firefly a great show, it was also the amazing cast.  People genuinely cared for the characters, and being able to see them again was, as I said, a dream come true.Six months after the series finale of Firefly, things have only gotten worse on the firefly-class transport ship Serenity.  Due to the overbearing government, known as the Alliance, work is becoming harder and harder to come by for petty thieves like Capt. Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew.  This is causing the ship to fall into further disrepair, despite the best efforts of their gifted mechanic, Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and makes flying the ship more and more difficult for skilled pilot Hoban \"Wash\" Washburn (Alan Tudyk).  Meanwhile, former crew members Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a registered companion (read: prostitute), and Sheperd Deria Book (Ron Glass) have left the ship for reasons that, while differnt, both involve Mal.  Furthermore, fugitive siblings Simon (Sean Maher) and River Tam (Summer Glau) are still wanted by the Alliance, and the government is getting desperate.  They have recently enlisted one of their nameless, rankless officers, known only as The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to bring in River Tam.  The Operative is simultaneously a ruthless killing machine, skilled in all types of combat and strategy, and an articulate orator who deeply believes in the possibility of a world without sin.While The Operative hunts down Serenity, Mal has decided to take River along with himself, Zoe Warren (Gina Torres), his first mate and wife to Wash, and Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) on their missions/jobs due to her ability to psychically read the thoughts of others.  Simon disapproves of this, fearing that she will somehow get hurt or caught.  Despite a good performance by River, Simon becomes enraged after the crew narrowly escapes an attack by Reavers (cannibalistic madmen) while on the mission, and decides that he and River are going to leave the ship and find a new transport.  Of course, things don't always go as planned on Serenity, and when the crew discovers one of River's latent abilities, they are forced to keep her onboard.Everything about this movie, in my opinion, goes well above and beyond any expectations I may have had prior to seeing it.  As usual, Joss Whedon delivers his trademark witty dialogue and (more importantly) an amazing plot.  A good amount of our questions from the series are not only answered, but answered superbly.  I never would have guessed at what really happened, and yet it makes sense and is truly a revelation.  Other questions were left unanswered, to be addressed in later movies (which unfortunately, as of right, now doesn't look like a possibility).  And while the level of character development isn't as good as it was in the series, this is a two-hour movie; there is only so much time to devote to each aspect (such as plot, action, and development).  Whedon has said that the film is pretty much season 2 of the series crammed into two hours.  He had to take out a lot of character stuff (such as a relationship between Mal and Inara) in order to tell us River's story.Furthermore, the actors all do phenominal jobs.  No one in the movie is on Hollywood's A-list, but I almost prefer it that way.  The original cast obviously have great chemistry together, and it is clear that they are all happy to be back.  Meanwhile, newcomers like Ejiofor and David Krumholtz give very solid performances as well (although Krumholtz's Mr. Universe is a bit of a silly character).For a film that was only made for about $40 million, the special effects look great.  With few exceptions (such as few shots in the chase scene near the beginning), the effects look seamless.  The ending battle is one of my favorite space battles in movie history, and yes, I have seen the original Star Wars trilogy.All in all, this is an amazing film.  I can't understand how it didn't take off.  It was supposed to be a sleeper hit, with word-of-mouth as its primary proponent.  For some reason, despite rave reviews from both mainstream and non-mainstream critics in addition to support from both old and new fans, the general movie-going public was very apathetic towards Serenity.  Sadly, a lot of people missed out on one of the year's best films.  Hopefully, the DVD* will win over all those people who didn't want to pay $10 for a ticket (so worth it).  Find Serenity, for there is no place that you can be once you find it.

In Serenity much of the family atmosphere disappears and we are left with a medium budget action film. This is not necessarily bad just different.The film starts about six months after the close of the series. River Tam (Summer Glau) has been broken out of a Government facility by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River has unwittingly been turned into a weapon by the government but more frightenly she harbors a secret that has the potential to weaken the govenment itself.

The characters are all ther from the show but they have changed in the time between the show's cancellation and the film's release. The Captain (Nathan Fillion) has become darker and more withdrawn. I think that his character is now closer to Whedon's original vision of him in the pilot episode. Other characters are not used as much as some of the fans may have wished but this is a limited run time film with nine main characters.Whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could. As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look. The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.I watched the two disc Collector's Edition. The picture and sound were almost perfect. There are two commentary tracks: one featuring the cast which is more anecdotal and a more technical commentary by Whedon himself.

In Joss Whedon's film 'Serenity', he gives us such a moment, and it's the kind that inspires goosebumps, tingles, and lumps in the throat.Firefly fans already know the back stories, both that of the doomed TV series and that of the little band of smugglers aboard the flying chicken.  On paper, it all sounds like another science fiction franchise that should have faded into obscurity along with scores of others.  But Joss Whedon has a knack for storytelling, and if anyone could deliver a quality Sci-Fi product, he'd be your guy.  Some of the elements are right off the shelf (just reach in blindly and close your hand around a dozen or so), and the fugitive brother and sister hitching a ride with a smuggler on a goofy-looking space freighter and playing keep-away from an enormously powerful and evil intergalactic organization might sound a bit familiar, but the story is thoroughly engrossing.  Most of the characters seem quite aware that they're in a SciFi movie, but they make it fun instead of getting mired in the usual self-important drudgery.  Nathan Fillion and Jewel Staite, in particular, throw out the kind of cheeky, out-of-line humor that fans of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' will appreciate.  One area where science fiction has really succeeded over the years has been in giving us cool new villains, and here we get The Operative, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor as a gentleman with a Samurai sword and an icily pleasant demeanor, sort of the Miles Drentell of SciFi movie nemeses.  Summer Glau's work as River is emotionally devastating, miles from the wooden performances we've come to expect from the B-level talent often associated with science fiction.  She has helped create a haunting, original character who, understandably, has an adoring cult following.  Joss Whedon has a thing for female characters who seem fragile, seem to need the protection of those around them, then emerge as suprisingly strong and capable just when the others need, well, a hero.  When River's moment arrives, she is equal to the challenge.(All this is coming from someone who despises science fiction.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars; that's more closely aligned with how good I think it is.  Most SciFi movies and TV series make the mistake of going all the way into outer space and years into the future so that they can tell a story that could have been told better in another genre.  The trappings of SciFi, with the aliens, gadgetry, and other techno-nonsense, usually seem like childish, unnecessary distractions from underdeveloped human elements.  With 'Serenity', Joss Whedon has a story that cannot be told in any other way, and his film is a success because he makes creative and effective use of the genre to serve his needs.

When Victor accidentally slips a ring onto her bony finger, she resolves to wed Victor and bring him back with her to the world of the dead.The sets are terrific, Victorian ghoulishness at it creepy finest.

One day, two killers on a spree, enter the diner and threaten customers and his waitress. Tom swiftly, and surprisingly, puts the two killers out of commission. Dubbed a local hero, every news channel runs a story on the heroic event, plastering Tom's picture all over the television. These stories attract the attention of Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), a mobster from Philadelphia who insists Tom is Joey Cusack, a former hitman who worked for his brother Richie Cusack (William Hurt). Tom doesn't know what he is talking about. Carl hangs around and begins to make things uncomfortable for the Stall family.\"A History of Violence\", directed by David Cronenberg, and based on a graphic novel, is a very good film, maybe one of the best I have seen so far this year.The best and most convincing thing about \"History\" is the acting. Mortensen, Bello and Ashton Holmes are all great. They are entirely convincing as the members of the Stall family, living in rural Indiana, enjoying their small town life. Viggo Mortenson (the \"Lord of the Ring\" series, but I didn't really need to tell you that, did I) is great as Tom. From the opening moments, when we first meet him and his wife drives him to work, we get the picture; small town guy, pleased with his small town life. Maria Bello (\"Secret Window\", \"The Cooler\") is also very good as Edie, his wife. Edie is a modern woman; she works as a lawyer during the day, but, much like her husband, her family comes first. Ashton Holmes plays their teenage son, who has the typical problems any teenager has; because he isn't the greatest athlete, he is picked on by other guys. He can handle them with words, but that only makes them more determined to beat the living cr*p out of him. The Stall's also have a young daughter, Sarah.Life is good for them until a couple of guys arrive in town. Drifting from town to town, looking for small businesses to hold up, they are psychopaths who think nothing of killing people who get in their way. The film opens with an act of violence by these two, setting the tone for the rest of their rampage. Finally, they make it to the small Indiana town and stop in Tom's diner just as he is closing. He decides to serve them, to keep them calm but things quickly escalate and Tom becomes a hero, saving his waitress and the inevitable carnage that would result from these two monsters.As soon as this happens, the media swarms his home and he becomes uncomfortable, trying to avoid the media. This same attention attracts the eye of Carl Fogarty (Harris) and his two sidekicks. They insist Tom is an old \"friend\" Joey Cusack, the man who gave Fogarty the scaring around his lame eye. Fogarty listens with deaf ears as Tom protests that he is not this Joey person, Edie doesn't listen either.But, as the film progresses, and Carl becomes more insistent, and begins to take matters into his own hands, Edie and their son, Ashton, begin to have their doubts.The violence that becomes a part of their lives also changes them, making their transformation all the more interesting.As Tom's identity becomes questioned by more and more people, he starts to take matters into his own hands. He can't have Fogarty and his men harassing or threatening his family and they won't simply go away. He has to solve the problem. Richie Cusack (William Hurt) soon tracks Tom down and Tom realizes that he won't have a moment's peace until he solves the problem with Richie. These scenes are good. But the real bread and butter of the film, what makes it so powerful, is watching the violence transform the life of the Stall family.Cronenberg does such a great job of portraying this simple family that we readily notice when they start to transform, when they start to have doubts. Tom does everything in his power to make his wife and family continue to believe in him, even as they witness him using violence to protect them, that it is almost heart wrenching to watch their loss of faith in the man they love.Even more interesting is watching the effects of violence on Edie and Jack. Each is equally amazed at all of the events that transpire around them, but they react in slightly different ways. As you watch, the action is riveting because we have already invested in these characters and want to see how the action turns out.There are two scenes between Tom and Edie which are very erotic. The first happens early on, when Tom and Edie are still Tom and Edie. They come home and have a little role playing fantasy. At first, it seems silly but Cronenberg quickly amps up the eroticism and this scene adds to their portrayal of a modern American couple. Later, another scene, equally erotic, but very different, helps to define the change in their relationship.The film opens with the psychotic drifters checking out of a small motel. Of course, we don't immediately realize they are psychotic, but this bit of information quickly becomes clear. Initially, I thought this was a prologue because one of the characters bears a striking resemblance to a young Viggo Mortensen. I think Cronenberg wants the confusion to exist as a way of linking Tom's questionable past to the current day. When the scene quickly cuts to Viggo, as Tom, walking into his home, there is still a question about how that younger guy fits into the story. Was it a flashback to Tom's life as a young man? Only when the two guys enter Tom's diner and start threatening people do we realize that they are two separate people. But the question still remains that they may be linked in other less tangible ways.\"A History of Violence\" is a great film, featuring outstanding performances, an interesting story, great direction and a riveting story.

I wasn't excited about watching this film as I had suspected that it was going to be another one of those mindless/predictable films filled with too much violence and no story line. Needless to say I was wrong about this movie.Yes, this movie has violence. More violence than I would normally enjoy watching, but it does have a good story line and the acting (especially by Viggo Mortensen) was good.In this movie we meet mild mannered family man, Tom Stall, played by Viggo Mortensen, who owns and runs his own diner in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. Life is good for Tom Stall and his family. Stall becomes a local hero who makes big media news when he defends/protects his small diner and its employees by killing two ruthless killers whom have come to rob the diner. Stall doesn't want the attention or even like the attention he receives from the media. The way he sees it is that he was only doing what any other normal citizen would do under those circumstances and wants nothing more than to return to the quiet lifestyle he once knew.Due to all of the media attention Stall receives, two men, whom are outsiders have come to town seeking out Stall and accusing him of being a ruthless killer named, Joey Cusack, from a mob/crime family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to which Stall denies. These two men keep harassing Stall and his family. Along the way the violent behavior and fight moves on Stalls part escalate which alludes to him being Joey Cusack, from a mob/crime family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Stall finally admits that he is Joey Cusack and that he returns to Philadelphia to confront his past.Don't want to spoil the ending, so watch the movie!", "qas": [{"question": "How is the scene?", "id": "409e7032db2286230b48c0e9d347fff6", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000E1MTYK", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Whoa! Potter is a big teenager, and there are no childlike scenes here. I want to say I appreciate the one reviewer that reads the books but only pointed out things from the book that probably should have been included to clarify some things. They are very valid points. At least she did not give us a blow by blow why the movie wasn't the book. I will probably get some negative votes because I am fed up with some book reviewers reviewing movies as though they are the same medium. The movies can no more be the book than the book can be the movie. Once you understand that is not possible you will begin to appreciate the fact that a great deal of effort goes into bringing the ESSENCE of the book to the big screen. As well pointed out unfortunately sometimes the screenwriters, directors, etc. don't get it right and there is something missing that should have been included from the book. The movies are all great and this one certainly is almost as good as the others. Harry must once again prove himself to his friends and the school.This time in a Tri-Wizard contest which he didn't even volunteer to be in. How was he selected? But that is only the beginning of questionable things happening. There is a bit more friction between him and Ron this time. But then considering their ages and the competitive nature of school, is it any wonder? The characters are further developed and the storyline is incredible. The special effects in the magic scenes are excellent. By far the scariest, and not for small children as some scenes are very intense. He must battle not only formidible creatures but his own mortality as well and watch the death of a friend. It will keep you guessing who he can trust to the very end. What struck me most is how much the people playing the characters, and the characters too have aged and matured. As in the books this story is definitely darker than previous ones. I highly recommend it for the adults, but not children and I am sure Rowling would tell you her books were never meant for young children. A bug being tortured, child morphed and tormented, Harry almost drowning, scary mermen attacking, a girl dragged underground by plants, and a young man being killed is not for the faint of heart.

K. Rowling, the young wizards seem to have a bit more on their minds than just flying around on broomsticks and casting spells.  For along with puberty come activated hormones and a sudden burgeoning interest in the opposite sex.  This brings a nice grown-up dimension to a series that continues to enchant young and old alike with its constantly renewing creativity and imagination.All, however, is not puppy love romance and fancy dress balls, for there is still the serious business of wizardry to be done at Hogwarts Academy.  In this edition, Harry is compelled to take part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a sort of Olympic Games for magicians that is so intense that it has resulted in the deaths of a few of the participants in the past.  In order to win the prize of the goblet of fire, the contestant must face three challenges - a battle with dragons, an underwater rescue of some kidnapped friends, and a trip through an elaborate maze, with the goal in each case being the capturing of a mysterious giant egg.  At the base of the contest lies the evil Lord Voldemort (a creepy Ralph Fiennes), who is, as always, trying to eliminate young Mr. Potter by any means necessary.Although a bit long at two hours and thirty-six minutes, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" still manages to breathe new life into a franchise that should by all rights be turning pretty stale by now.  It does so partly through some really fine set pieces - i.e. the challenges - partly through the high flying imaginativeness of so much of the storyline, partly through the endearing relationships among the various characters, and partly through the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, who keeps Harry Potter lifelike, compelling and interesting as an everyman hero.  The tone is also remarkably dark in the later stretches of the film, as is befitting the advancing ages of the characters, although very young children might find some of the scenes a trifle disturbing, so be forewarned.Filled with beautiful images and dazzling special effects, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" is another worthy addition to a series that is fast becoming a modern day classic in its own right.", "qas": [{"question": "Is this story about a cowboy?", "id": "fc280185029c986c49ef3dcea9f638f0", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000E1YVZU", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I'll preface my review by saying that I am only passingly familiar with the play Rent. Before watching the movie, I had been turned onto seeing it after listening to the music from the Broadway show, but I have never seen the play actually performed. As such, I can't really comment on how this film stacks up to the play, only how it stands on its own as a film.What strikes me about Rent early on is the very good acting by all of the cast. For most of this, I can chalk it up to experience with the characters; most of the original cast of the play makes it into the movie and thus they have 10 plus years of working with their parts. However, even the new additions are very well acted. The characters of Rent live a carefree Bohemian lifestyle, but there is still an incredible sadness within them. Most of the cast has AIDS and is doomed to die in a very painful manner. Those who do not have AIDS live with the knowledge that they will have to watch as their friends die. For most of the film, those emotions go unstated, but they are clearly in the background for every character.A solid example of this sadness on the inside comes through during the song \"Another Time,\" when Mimi flirts with Roger and he pushes her away because of his fear of opening up to someone as he dies of the virus. In a very angry song, he breaks down for a moment and begins saying softly, \"I should tell you, I should tell you...\" only to explode in anger again. The performance is very subtle, but Roger's pain remains evident in his voice even as he keeps it hidden. The characters are as real as fictional constructs can be; they do not simply feel happy or sad or angry. They carry around a mix of emotions, and the actors portray those mixed emotions as they try to have a good time in what are potentially their final days.The music of Rent is obviously one of the highlights of the film. Although many songs have been cut out from the play, probably due to the time constraints on a film, the important ones are still there and they still sound terrific. If anything, the cast has improved in their musical talent over the years, and the wide variety of quirky and beautiful songs written by the late Jonathan Larson are all performed to perfection. The music remains important to the plot, advancing the storylines and highlighting all the key moments of the film.Rent is a movie that covers all of the emotions that a person would realistically have when they are facing something as powerful and deadly as AIDS. The performances are sharp and the music is terrific. This is a film that will move you from happiness to anger to sadness and back again, covering everything in between along the way.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the story?", "id": "3b5abee420c77629268b235b70d8a1f6", "answers": [{"text": "Rent is a movie that covers all of the emotions that a person would realistically have when they are facing something as powerful and deadly as AIDS", "answer_start": 2360}]}]}]}, {"title": "B000E33VWW", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Somerset Maugham liked to characterize himself as a good writer of the second rank.  Much the same can be said of Truman Capote, with the caveat that he wrote one book of the first rank, his astonishing nonfiction novel IN COLD BLOOD.  This marvelous film tells the story of the writing of that book and reiterates the theory of one of Capote's most prominent biographers that the writing of that book was not merely the culmination of his career, but the cause of his decline as a writer and his descent into alcoholism.  The past few years has seen an explosion of biopics, but by any standard this has to stand as one of the very finest, and perhaps even the best.Whatever other merits this film has-and it has many-first and foremost is the incarnation of Truman Capote in the performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Almost every year going into Oscar season we see at least one performance that so completely overwhelms all of the others it seems inconceivable that that performance will not win the Oscar.  Last year that performance was Imelda Staunton in VERA DRAKE.  This year that performance is Hoffman in CAPOTE.  No performance in 2005 by either a male or female came anywhere near the job that Hoffman did here.  What is astonishing is not merely that Hoffman did such a magnificent job of imitating Capote's voice and mannerisms that he seems to be channeling rather than impersonating him but that within that imitation he delivered a performance of enormous subtlety and emotional range.  In other words, this performance truly is more about acting than about imitation, though the imitation is impeccable, despite the fact that Hoffman is far too tall for the role (but, then, Peter O'Toole was about a foot too tall to play the diminutive T. E. Lawrence in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA).  Hoffman's performance is so dominating and so remarkable that it alone would have been sufficient to guarantee the film's success, but luckily he is far from the only good thing in the film.This film, which has been widely reported as having been shot in slightly more than a month, is remarkable on almost every level.  The period look is impeccable from the dress to the d&eacute;cor of rooms.  Every aspect of the production is first rate, but what really shines is the superb cast, which is populated with a host of great character actors.  Apart from Hoffman no one performer stands out, but that is more a testimony to the overall excellence of the cast than the failure of any actor.  Chris Cooper, Catherine Keener (a great beauty who glams down in this one as Capote's close friend Harper Lee-the odd kid in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was modeled on Lee's childhood friend Truman--showing that she is going in middle age going to be one of our most versatile actresses), Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy), Bob Balaban, and Mark Pellegrino all perform marvelously in a very strong cast.  Clifton Collins Jr., an actor I previously knew only from several appearances on the television show ALIAS, was very good in the key role of Perry Smith, one of the two murderers with whom Capote somewhat identified and who he both befriended and exploited in writing his book.The story, of course, revolves around Capote's investigation of the horrific murder of a well liked and important family in a small town in Kansas.  Each of the victims had been bound and shot in the head with a shot gun.  After a police hunt two young men, Perry Smith and Richard Hickcock, were arrested for the crime.  They were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death.  During the proceedings Capote, who was covering the murders for the New Yorker, befriended Smith, who has a background similar to Capote's own.  The film is superb at showing the complexity of human motivation, how Capote both truly likes Smith and yet exploits him shamelessly while also being repulsed by him.  The cold-blooded manner in which Capote both exhibits tremendous compassion for Smith and lies to him about the state of his book is almost as scary as the murder that Smith commits in flashback.  Smith repeatedly asks Capote about how much he has written and what the title of the book will be and is told that he has made little progress on his untitled work.  In fact, Capote has nearly finished the book, largely waiting to find out whether Smith and Hickcock will succeed on their appeals of their death sentence, and very early on settled on the title.  A mark of how good the movie is comes when how tortured Capote is shown to be by his exploitation of Smith.  At the end his guilt drives him to agree to witness Smith's hanging.  The story from beginning to end is both riveting and horrifying.  I kept thinking of how the title of Capote's great book could be applied to almost every aspect of the entire story.I would highly recommend anyone who has seen this film but has not yet read IN COLD BLOOD to do so as soon as possible.  This truly is one of the most marvelously written books in the past half century.  The prose is as exquisite as any written in English during that period, with the nightmarish, harrowing murders portrayed as coldly and dispassionately as they were committed.  Throughout Capote distances himself from his subject matter and although to any attentive reader it becomes obvious that he has inside knowledge of many of the events in the book, he does not appear in any guise whatsoever.  If one knows nothing about Capote's involvement with Smith and Hickcock, as I did when I first read the book, it is clear that at the very least he conducted extensive interviews with everyone associated with the case.  Knowing how deeply involved Capote actually was makes his utter absence in the book especially eery.  IN COLD BLOOD is one of the finest American books of the past century and this fine film will hopefully be watched in conjunction with it in the future.  I will close by adding that while IN COLD BLOOD was made into a superb film (starring Robert Blake as Perry Smith), I think CAPOTE is an even better film.  I cannot recommend either the book or the movie more highly.", "qas": [{"question": "Was the story and performance good?", "id": "1dd157bd5793461b16214edc6ae5419b", "answers": [{"text": "he delivered a performance of enormous subtlety and emotional range", "answer_start": 1436}]}]}]}, {"title": "B000EOTTTU", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The New World  (2006)  Colin Farrell, Q'orianka Kilcher, Christopher PlummerRated PG.Finally, a more realistic depiction of the Pocahontas legend and the brutal hardships suffered by our founding colonists.This is not an action movie.

This started out with some great intensity and it did not slow down during the rest of the match. This had everything trash cans, street signs, tables barb wire bats, thumbtacks, and tables set on fire. The only thing i wished for is if they would have given this match another 5 minutes.

Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle for the WHT- This was a good match except they gave this no time for it to be a good main event for samckdown. All you had to do was take the pillow fight or the booker match off the card and we could have got a soild 20 minute match maybe even more instead we get a ten minute match. Saying all that the match did not turn out bad it was jsut rushed. Lots of action the whole match and tons of near falls. The crowd was not that behind rey as i thought they would be but it was still a good match. A little bit predictable. Winner and new WHC Rey mysterio. Match Rating 8/10.10. Torrie Wilson vs. Candice in a playboy pillow fight- this was another waste of time the only good part was lokking at the girls. I think it was a good decision that they put this after the triple threat match to cool the crowd down not that exciting at all and a waste of time for the most part. Winner Torrie Wilson.

I am a big HHH fan and to cena get booed the hell out of made me so happy. I used to be a cena fan but i think he had held the title to long. The crowd was as loud as i ever remember it being sience rock vs. hogan at wrestlemania 18. This match started out slow but soon picked up and it was non stop action for the last 6 minutes of the match. Lots of near falls and alot better than alot of people thought it was going to be. Good main event. Winner and still wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 8.5/10.Well that raps up another. i would give wrestlemania 22 a grade of 74.5/110 which is a 66% which means this was a good ppv. If they had took off the ooker and pillow fight match this would have been alot better. Why not put mnm in there. I would still get this right away when this dvd comes out.

The Broadway show was, by far, my favorite show of all time (saw it twice).  I was in awe.  I also loved the movie, even though I disagree with some choices.  They made some unnecessary changes to some major songs that I disagreed with.  They left out parts of Fontines' death song, made some word changes to the finale (I would have liked Eponine to join Fontine and come floating down as angels) and made other changes.  I would have left the songs as they were.  I was also a bit disappointed in Russell Crowe's performance - both his acting and singing.  In addition, though I loved the sets and photography, I would have held the long shots longer in &#34;One Day More&#34; and the &#34;Finale&#34; and done fewer rapid face shots.  These differences aside, I loved all of the other performances and was amazed that these famous actors could sing so well and do it while acting at the same time - all done live, not dubbed.  The performances were spectacular and I agree with the Oscar to Anne Hathaway.  She was brilliant.  I loved Hugh Jackman, as well, and Elizabeth Barks was terrific as Eponine.  I was totally moved by this motion picture and started an ovation at the end of the movie, joined by the others in the theater.

Perhaps this stems from the fact that I find the voices of the principle cast members from the original London and Broadway recordings less than enjoyable. What selections I had heard sung by other vocalists interested me in the music; and, not having seen the show live on stage, I went into this film with not much in the way of expectations. When I came out, I was more than impressed; I was blown away. The music was wonderful, the costumes and sets gorgeous, and the acting...Well, let's just say that more than a few Oscar statuettes are going to be passed around between this marvelous cast.For those who don't know it already, the story of \"Les Miserables\", written by Victor Hugo in 1862 and set in France in the first half of the 19th century, concerns Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), a convict, out on parole after spending 19 years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread. After the intervention of the kindly Bishop of Digne (played by Colm Wilkinson), who convinces him to \"become an honest man\" and foster a belief in God, the story follows him as he attempts to escape from his past life--and the dogged Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe)--his interactions with various characters, and the repercussions that these interactions will have. Like the title suggests, the film is not a jolly, old-fashioned, toe-tapping extravaganza. Most of the film is either heart-wrenching or gut-wrenching, oftentimes both, and isn't afraid to deliver tough emotional blows one after the other; yet, despite the overabundance of death and despair, I was inexplicably uplifted and inspired in a way that only a good musical can achieve.It was a genius decision on director Tom Hooper's part to have the actors sing live instead of favoring the more traditional method of recording in a studio and lip-synching later. They are much more \"in-the moment\", and bring a more truthful sound to the music. While they seem to be a bit more restrained than if they were live on stage, which, for anyone who is used to the typically, big, bold sound of Broadway, might be a little disconcerting at first, it makes the performances so much more raw and real than what one typically expects to find in a movie musical; and with almost every song from \"Les Mis\" being more of a soliloquy with instrumental accompaniment than anything else, it works like a charm. Hopefully this will set a precedent for movie musicals in the future.Even if you think you know the songs already, it's like hearing them for the very first time, they sound so fresh and unique, with elegant yet unobtrusive new orchestrations and thrilling vocal performances across the cast. Anne Hathaway's bravura, one-take rendition of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" brought me to tears, and Hugh Jackman's \"Bring Him Home\" is quite possibly the most beautiful and touching version I have ever heard. The new song \"Suddenly\", written by the musical's original composers especially for this film, is excellent, adding some much needed optimism to the score (as well as a nice breather!), and is perfectly suited to its place in the film--sung by Valjean after he has rescued little Cosette from the cruel Thenadiers. Jackman brings a deep poignancy and tenderness to the lyrics, which might be due to the fact that he is an adoptive father in real life.Although most of the dialogue is sung-through rather than simply spoken, the acting is as good or better than in a regular, non-musical drama. Anne Hathaway will break your heart as the unfortunate Fantine, who is forced to sacrifice everything she has for the sake of her child. Her acting ability has really reached new heights, and don't even get me started on her singing. The few pieces to which she contributes her voice to had me bawling my eyes out. If anyone deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar this year, it's her.Hugh Jackman is so good as the reformed convict Jean Valjean it would be hard to imagine anyone but him in the part. At last, he has been given a role worthy of his prodigious talents--the only thing he doesn't do here is dance! He so completely becomes the man, transforming himself into a nearly-unrecognizable shadow in the first part of the film, it is almost impossible to tell where Valjean begins and Jackman ends. His voice is powerful and thrilling, and he does a great job of making each song his own. I could listen to him all day. Even if you don't like musicals, you should still see this, if only to enjoy his stellar performance.The rest of the cast are also uniformly incredible, including Eddie Redmayne, a total musical surprise to me, who, as Marius, is a great romantic lead; Samantha Barks as the poor, heartbroken Eponine; Russell Crowe as the conflicted, duty-bound Javert (who knew he could sing?); and the incomparable Helena Bonham-Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as M. and Mme. Thenadier, who provide a much-needed, if slightly Sweeney-Todd-esque, comic relief to what would otherwise be non-stop despair. The only weak link in the chain is Amanda Seyfried as Cosette--her voice is quite thin--but wasn't so bad that it ruined my enjoyment of the songs. It was also great to see Colm Wilkinson, the original Jean Valjean, as the Bishop of Digne.What I found most refreshing about this production is that director Tom Hooper isn't afraid to let this film be what it is, a big screen adaptation of a musical--loud, theatrical, often implausible, and unashamedly heart-tugging--yet for all its broadness, the overall feeling is of something quite intimate, not nearly as bombastic and overblown as the trailers would have you think, and very character-driven. It is the music and the emotions that are epic, not the movie itself. Just as he did with \"The King's Speech\", he makes you become so deeply connected to the characters themselves that you're ready and willing to be manipulated to experience any emotion on their behalf. Case in point, by the finale, I was weeping like a child. While he might have gone a bit overboard with the whole steadycam/closeup thing, it really does put you right in the middle of the action--how often do you go to a live performance where you can see the tears in the actors eyes before they've even fallen down their cheeks?The only real problem I had with the movie was with the plot itself (too many characters dying tragic deaths, too much melodrama, too much focusing on the student revolutionaries, and, towards the latter end, too much time spent behind barricades and in cafes instead of fighting). All of this drags the film out a little longer than it should, but it is Victor Hugo after all, and his work is the epitome of French literature. For anyone worried about content, there wasn't really anything worse than what you might see in your average PG-13 movie, no real nudity, and only brief language, but some of the scenes involving prostitutes were a little excessive at times, and certainly not necessary to deepen my emotional connection with the main characters.To conclude, \"Les Miserables\" is a real masterpiece, with a fabulous cast and some of the most beautiful music ever written. I can't say any more about this film other than that is an emotional rollercoaster, and if you can ride it out, it is well worth the trip. Just be prepared to have lots of tissues on hand when you do.", "qas": [{"question": "How is it music ?", "id": "1016e3e8ded3a329056298315769c37c", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "If you've never seen Les Miserables in any form, then please, watch this movie.

Clearly it was a shoddy movie, but to a kid you just can't buy that kind of palpable movie madness.Now I'm as old as my parents were when they saw the very first Superman, and I've got to say this must be what it felt like. I think Bryan Singer is fast becoming one of the most respectable directors in Hollywood, and what he did with this movie--on a far, far grander scale than either of his X-Men movies--merits SOME kind of award come Oscar time.We all know the story--Kryptonian boy comes to Earth, saves man from the foibles of archnemesis Lex Luthor, woos Lois Lane. Singer and Co. decided to have this movie pick up after Superman II (wise move) but you never really get a jarring sense of chronology--no General Zod references here. Instead, Supe has just returned from a nearly five-year journey to see if anything remains of his homeworld; alas, the answer is no.What's strange is that him being gone is such a small deal when it comes to the overall movie. But that's okay; there's plenty more fantastic things to keep the average moviegoer and Superman afficionado happy. What I love most about this sequel is that so much of it feels like home--Brandon Routh has moments where he looks exactly like the dearly departed Christopher Reeve, and his voice is dead-on most of the time. He quotes several lines from the first movie to great effect. Kate Bosworth as Lois isn't as quirky as Margot Kidder but she still can't spell, and she does the best job I've seen in a long time of playing the \"strong female\" role without ever drawing your attention to it.The plot also feels familiar--Superman spends a night righting wrongs across the world; Luthor AGAIN gets hold of that Adis Ababa kryptonite, and Supe AGAIN falls prey to it; but there are intriguing elements dealing with Fortress crystals that take Luthor into land-grabbing madness like we've never seen.The special effects are superb, of course; you can't spend almost $300 million and get it wrong! Here is where I thought Singer might overdo things, but his restraint is commendable. He allows Routh to do all the old Superman things and yet they don't feel aged at all. Singer was concerned with how to entertain a generation where flying is no longer the spectacle it once was, and yet, watching the movie, it's hard to believe that any kid, no matter how jaded, could scoff at what's on screen.

In fact, I didn't see one guy without his shirt or a shower scene. Don't listen to bogus reviews. Please, don't listen to these comments, because you will be missing a marvelous, sharp, beautiful and BASED ON A TRUE STORY World War I picture that blew me away.The extent that the filmmakers went to make this a realistic, poigniant and time capturing homage to the FLYBOYS of World War I who went over to France BEFORE America joined the war, is stunning. After watching this film, I couldn't believe that this film hasn't received more accolades.It's a little one dimensional, but that was the way life was for the pilots of World War I who were volunteering to fly war planes only years after the plane was even invented. They arrived in France, they trained for three weeks and they were flying missions that had claimed thousands of lives and had a less than 5% return rate.In between missions, their lives were dull and simple. Parked in the middle of a French country side, they would frequent a single pub and drink to the men who didn't return that day.FLYBOYS is based on real stories from journals of the real men the movie portrays. The lives they left behind to become pilot gods. The loves they lost and left behind. The people they met and the amazing world changing missions they embarked on.James Franco plays Blaine Rawlings, a young man who was about to lose his ranch and be arrested, motivating him to enter World War I as a fighter pilot before the American government joined the fight. He meets a beautiful french women named Lucienne (newcomer Jennifer Decker) who speaks little english, but their bond is realistic and beauiful portrayed.The most breathtaking part of FLYBOYS is the battle scenes themselves. The planes circle and dart between the clouds, streaming their clouds of bullets across the sky. The rudementry targeting system and the flaws in their guns. Everything is captured.Bottom line. FLYBOYS is breath-taking. A wonderful film and exactly the kind of movie that Howard Hughes wanted to make.

That book served as the basis for this film.This is truly one of my favorite films. Bale is terrific as always as Alfred Borden, and Jackman delivers what I consider to be his finest performance as the obsessive, vindictive Robert Angier. Michael Caine's supporting role as Angier's ingenieur of allusions is a charming and vital, as the opening and closing narration are provided by his character.  The lovely Scarlett Johansson also delivers one of the finest performances of her young career.I won't summarize the plot of the film, as that's already been done thoroughly by past reviewers, but I will comment on the differences between the book and the film.As you might imagine, the film is much different.  The book begins with a journalist venturing to the home of a descendent of Angier for an interview.  The majority of the book and most of the content of the film comes from the personal diary of Angier and retellings by Angier's descendent. In the book, the rivalry between Borden and Angier begins not with the accidental death of Angier's wife, but with Borden sabotaging a seance of Angier's at a private residence.  The book goes into great and fascinating detail about the pasts of the two main characters, which was, in my opinion, a major omission from the film.I want to go into greater detail about the differences, but I'm afraid I'd spoil a great read for whomever takes my advice and reads the book.

Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as a young boy gets sucked into working for Boston Irish Mafia boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When he grows up, he ends up joining the State Police under Frank Costello's direction in order to be an inside man, or a rat, for the boss. Sullivan keeps Costello tipped off, and in-turn, Costello gives Sullivan information to help him solve cases. He promotes quickly and ends up working for the State Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) who's sole task is to bring down Frank Costello.Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is also a State Policeman, or \"Statey,\" who's troubled past brings him to the attention of Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) who heads up the undercover division of the Boston Police overseen by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). Dignam and Queenan are convinced that Costigan's high intelligence combined with his dubious background make him unsuitable as a traditional cop, so they offer him a job as an off-the-books, deep cover agent meant to infiltrate Costello's gang.Things get hairy when Sullivan, now working for the SIU, learns with certainty that the police have an undercover cop infiltrated into Costello's gang. The police then begin to suspect Costello has a rat inside the force. Sullivan gets yet another promotion, but this time his job is to find the rat inside the force. The problem is he is the rat. Meanwhile, Costello has another job for Sullivan: find out who the undercover cop is! Dignam and Queenan know the only way they are going to find the rat is through Costigan who's life is becoming more dangerous by the second. Which of each other Sullivan or Costigan find out first is a deadman.Thoughts:The only two real flaws I found in Infernal Affairs were the scene direction and lack of character development. I knew these were two things that Martin Scorsese was a master of, so I was very eager to see his take on the story. Exactly as I predicted, The Departed is a much deeper version of the story. You get a much stronger feel for the characters. The story definately moves slower, but you never get bored during any scenes. As well, the dialogue benefits greatly from this, and it's simply great!It's a very rare thing for such a stellar cast as featured in this film to be used so well. Most of the time when a film touts such a list of screen icons, most of them have bit roles and barely make an impact on the film. Here everyone's presence is strongly felt, and it's a wonder to behold such a cast working on such a strong film under one of the greatest film directors in history. Jack Nicholson reminds us of why he's the legend he is. Leonardo DiCaprio slams the lid on naysayers, and even Mark Wahlberg's performance is so good he blends right in with the amazing talent around him. You may even find yourself talking about his character more than any other after the film.The film is not perfect however. It does tend to feel a bit too long once you reach the third act, but not so much as to sway your overall feelings of the film. I knew and expected the film to be different from it's Chinese counterpart if simply for the fact that these are different societies and cultures we are talking about, however I didn't expect (and didn't approve of) how much The Departed would walk the lines of every idea being so black and white. In The Departed, good cops are good, and the bad cops are bad. Scorsese even makes a strong point never to show Costigan performing any truly bad deeds. Meanwhile Infernal Affairs makes a strong point to show shades of grey where neither cop was truly good and neither was truly bad. Instead, it focused on how each lived in their own hell and how it motivated their actions. The ending to Infernal Affiars was deep and thoughtful, while by comparison, The Departed feels almost cliche and very much like a \"Hollywood Ending.\"The Verdict:The Departed is easily the best crime drama since Heat. It's everything Miami Vice should have been. Martin Scorsese was born to make films like this, and this film is easily his best film since Goodfellas which coincidentally or not so coincidentally share common themes. In this film he masterfully weaves a complicated web of intrigue and deception.

He's always thinking one step ahead of his superiors.The two lives of DiCaprio and Damon intertwine through minor 'almost' meetings and just misses.  Each of them has set out to detrmine who the rat is for the other side.  Each of them have the task of protecting their own lives and careers while helping those undeserving.  Yet, with all the similarities within each character, they're complete opposites.  Both of them make a living and income from a life of crime. One attempts to shut it down while commiting it elsewhere.  The other tries to commit crimes while wearing the facade he's trying to shut it down elsewhere.The movie is overall fun if nothing else.  For the movie buff who enjoyed Casino, Mean Streets, Goodfellas or any other underground urban gangster film, this is their type of adventure.  Even for some waiting and hoping again for the classic Nicholson craziness audiences love.  His boisterious mannerisms, cocky attitude and smartass evilness is all here in glowing technicolor.  The movie is violent to say the least, and gory especially near the end.  However, it's done reasonably and with merit because it's meant to get the point across of how violent and disgusting a life of crime can get.Clocking in at a little over 2 and a half hours, it's amazing just how little the movies paced dragged on.  Every frame is filled with either excitement, great drama, fantastic acting, or shocking gasp-worthy scenes.Even the music, Scorseses masterful use of classic rock songs from the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd (redone by someone else, unsure of who.) The music doesn't downplay the violence, instead it enhances it.I must say for anyone who doesn't care for Leo DiCaprio (I'm one of them,) this movie will change your mind a bit.  One should with all warrant, feel your heartstrings pull for this character in a tough spot no matter which path in life he chooses.  If anyone doesn't care for Matt Damon as an actor (my wife for example,) this movie isn't going to change your mind soon.  His character is one of pure arrogance and selfishness, one may feel like taking a crowbar to him within the first 15 minutes of his screentime.From the streets of deep, dark Boston, the story of brotherhood on both sides of the law is intriguing and disturbing and and joy to behold.Watch...and enjoy!!", "qas": [{"question": "How is the one?", "id": "79cb1291bab5833f38ddff3a8b179f63", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Are you a nark?

It's hard to believe, but then then look to see the other best picture nominees the year \"Chariots of Fire\" won the Oscar. Even those who don't agree about most films, will agree that ANY of the other nominees that year would have made for a more deserving winner. The starting point that I am trying to make is that good/amazing work is sometimes not awarded the acclaim that it should, but whether the Academy gets it right or not, we the public know is \"best\" as per our own appreciaton. I've learned to appreciate the work and put aside the awards hoopla that only serves as a point of departure for conversation about great movies.Is \"The Departed\" a great movie? You better believe it. I have not enjoyed a Scorsese picture this much since \"Goodfellas.\" The story is engrossing, the performances are captivating, and the execution is that of a director at the peak of his capabilities. While the movie is over 2 1/2 hours along, it seems to pass almost too quickly. It is worth noting that, like many Scorsese films, this one has graphic violence to boot and I would caution anyone to take kids to see this film, as some scenes are among his most shocking.While you may have read something about the plot. I am not big on revealing anything that might give away part of the joy of experiencing a movie which you know as little about as possible, but enough to get a gage as whether it's a \"you\" movie or not. I can tell you that both Matt Damon and Leonard DiCaprio give the best performances of their careers. I've never been a huge fan of DiCaprio, but they both surprised me and both are Oscar-worthy performances. Damon is growing into one of this generation's best. Not showy and always present. For some, Jack Nicholson can sometimes be too \"Jack,\" but with the exception of a couple of scenes (one of which is hilarious) he stays within his character. The supporting cast is flawless.The story itself challenges you to concentrate and keeps your adrenalin flowing PAST the last frame. Unlike some past Scorsese movies, this one injects a strong dose of humor between all the deception, double-crossing, and graphic violence. I saw this movie a couple of days ago and will be getting the DVD upon its upcoming release. At that time I may update this review to reveal whether the DVD has any extras worth noting.While I won't be watching the Oscars as I's rather watch the arrivals and hear the resesults the next day, I would not be surprised if this movie were to win honors for both best film and best director. If it does not win, it won't be for lack of deserving to as it's one of the best of the year. I give this movie an unqualified 5-stars.

Like The Pink Panther, James Bond was soon to follow. Daniel Craig is good but in my opinion he lacks the suave sophistication that Connery, Moore and Brosnan had. He's a fine actor though, able to handle the action (especially Le Chiffre's torture), dramatic and romance scenes. Eva Green was a brilliant choice as Vesper. Unlike previous Bond girls where they had to be a government agent or nuclear physicist in order to be an equal with Bond, Vesper is able to make jabs at Bond and hold her own against his sexist ways but her character is not action oriented and emotionally vulnerable, which makes her more feminine than some of her predecessors. The shower and final scenes are the best examples I can give on how, other than Tracy from OHMSS, Vesper is the only woman Bond has ever fallen in love with. Le Chiffre, while not one of the more memorable villains in the Bond canon, is big step up from the bratty Gustav Graves. He is cold, calculating and not afraid to cut Bond down to size if he doesn't tell him what he wants to know. Judi Dench, the only connection to the previous films, returns as M, who is shown more in this film but some of her scenes just seem unnecesary to the storyline. The plot is good, though the only parts that are adapted from the original novel are the casino and torture scenes. I do hate that they made it seem that Le Chiffre had a hand in 9/11. In this and the following Bond film, I hate how they're striving too hard for realism, in the past, the politcal points of the films were always subtle (the Cold War, detante and the fall of Communnism) and sometimes actually relevant to the story. The reference to 9/11, to me anyways, just seemed pointless as it adds nothing to Le Chiffre's character or the plot. There are too many action sequences in this film, which hurts it a little bit. They make Bond seem like Superman, jumping around on top of construction sites and bursting through walls (I could hear the George Reeves Superman theme in my head when he did that). And the way Bond heals from all of his wounds is so astounding, he'd put Wolverine to shame. David Arnold provides probably his best Bond score, though his music, especially for the action sequences, are loud and obnoxious. And I know that this is Bond's first mission, but that doesn't mean he should just barely use the Bond Theme. I think it was Arnold himself on a special feature on the Bond music who said \"Don't be afraid to use the Bond Theme. If it's not in the film, its just a regular action film.\" Or something of that nature anyway (and I hope they stop making the Bond films look and feel like a regular action film. The Bonds have always been different from the rest and the direction the producers are going in are practically disgracing Broccoli's hard work).

I tend to avoid the big Hollywood Blockbuster movies (ie. Batman, Superman, Spiderman etc.) and am typically more into independent and/or \"artsy\" films, but I do enjoy good action/adventure as well.

I am not going to lie to you, Sean Connery still is, and probably will always be, my favorite Bond, but Craig comes pretty close to the Master. And he is undoubtedly better than the last couple of actors that attempted the feat of portraying one of the most charismatic secret agents ever.This time around, the plot takes us from Madagascar to the Bahamas. In the process we find bankers stealing money from Freedom Fighters, bomb-makers with clear and important targets in mind, a fair amount of poker playing, and of course, attractive women. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the differences in Bond's personality compared to the other movies. Here we can see how his attitude towards women changed and the reasons behind this. Also, there are many details that if you have watched the previous Bond productions you will not see in this one. Even though one of these shows up towards the end, you will miss several Bond traits that are always present. It is fun to go through the movie spotting these absences.The action scenes are exciting and even though they are unrealistic, as is usually the case with Bond movies, this aspect was toned down from the latest efforts. The high speed chase on foot in Madagascar is remarkable and very well filmed, and even though it runs for a fair amount of time, we do not get bored in the least. As I already mentioned, there is also quite a bit of poker playing. This is only natural, seeing the popularity this game has gained lately. The good news is that they managed to keep these scenes interesting and they fit well with the rest of the plot.Just when I was ready to accept that there will never be a James Bond that will make me want to see these movies again, I was pleasantly surprised by Craig.

So I can readily accept him in the role of everyone's favorite spy.BUT- the movie is inconsistent (especially as far as the other films go), has about 6 major plot holes, is ENTIRELY predictable and to be blunt, it just doesn't have the refinement of the others in the franchise. I know this is supposed to be a \"reimagining\" or what have you, but here's the problem - there are more Bond movies than any other character in history, so clearly the series wasn't really suffering so badly that it needed revamping in the first place. In the second, one of the things that always made Bond interesting was that he is a distinguished ladies man, a gentleman spy if you will. Here he is written like every other run of the mill spy on celluloid. For a minute I thought I watching one of the Bourne movies. There are no gadgets, no Q, no sly witticisms (at least none that really work) and Bond has none of the qualities that make him the classic character he is. Here he becomes a clone of the latest successful actioners, and despite the weak \"prequel\" premise, he is simply not remotely related to James Bond. My wife and I were bored silly. On top of that, IF this is supposed to be happening prior to any of the other movies, then the timelines, technologies and characters are so inconsistent that the whole thing falls apart. I for one am tired of movie makers trying to reinvent the wheel with the most succesful franchises in the industry and destroying my favorite characters in the process. If they want to redo a movie then let them take something completely and utterly insipid like Boogey Man and reinvent that.Call me a purist if you want to, but frankly when something works - don't fix it ya know? I think we need to hold movie makers up to higher standards because otherwise they will keep rehashing good movies and continue to fail at coming up with anything original, so I don't think having higher standards is a bad thing. Whatever. Regardless, when watched with an objective eye, this movie fails in every way that counts. If this were a new character, I may have enjoyed it more.

Of course this film is terrible and deserves the shellacking it took but my concern lies with the rest of the trilogy they had promised us. I sincerely hope that the egg \"Eragon\" laid last winter won't be the end of \"Eldest\" and the subsequent sequel. Fox just needs to saddle up and make a better movie, then those kids will actually show up.The film is quite obviously trying to be \"Lord of the Rings\" for a smaller set. The story involves an impoverished people living under the boot of a ruthless king (yawn). One day a boy named Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds an egg which hatches the oh so famous blue dragon. Since the dragon, Saphira, becomes the hope of the proletariat the evil powers that be feel as though she must be killed. Jeremy Irons, good here but no miracle worker, is the town rabble rouser who sits in the town tavern and taunts the royal guards. Soon he joins forces with Eragon and Saphira to hunt down some young piece of meat who honestly nobody cares about. Eragon, like all kids these days, feels as though he can conquer the world just by mustering enough can do spirit. It is the type of mind set that lands people in the Middle East. The team travels the countryside dodging baddies and trying (and failing) to crack wise. It is all a pretext for some stupid battle that only exists to send the fan boys home happy. And really there is no reason this movie had to be so unwatchable, it is just poorly written and poorly directed. Plus Speleers acting won the movie no points either. He with his frozen face and forced delivery was plucked from who knows where for his ability to attract the Tiger Beat crowd, not his acting ability.  How do I know this? Well because near the end of the movie, for no good reason, he takes his shirt off and shows us some skin. Just what I had been hoping for. *3/4", "qas": [{"question": "How is it story?", "id": "60a43448968d33bfd677319464a568a1", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000NOIX48", "paragraphs": [{"context": "The time is 1925, the place China. Dr. and Mrs. Walter Fane, having lived in Shanghai for two years, are traveling to a remote area of the country because of a cholera epidemic, despite the fact that Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is a bacteriologist, not a physician. He and Kitty Fane (Naomi Watts) have lived in China since they were first married.The trip to the cholera-infested village is a far cry from that of their arrival, as there is a palpable tension between them. It seems that Kitty was unfaithful to him with the Vice Consul of Shanghai, Charlie Townsend (Liev Schrieber). When Walter tells her of the epidemic he has volunteered to help with, she informs him that is no place for a woman, and refuses to go... until he tells her if she does not, he will file for divorce, which would be a heavy blow to her social position.The Painted Veil, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, explores the relationship between Walter and Kitty against the backdrop of the epidemic. I've covered the story in more depth in my review of the book. When I saw there was a film, I was curious to know how well it was adapted to the screen.The story has been fleshed out somewhat, of necessity, as the novel is in Kitty's POV, which does not tell us as much as we'd like of Walter and his mindset. I think the screenwriter bridged the gap rather well, and Edward Norton brings him to life, endearing him to me in a way the novel never did.Naomi Watts plays Kitty well. She begins the film as a shallow, empty-headed woman whose sole goal in life is to be married, not for love but because it's the thing to do. She justifies her affair to herself because she doesn't love Walter, and she believes herself in love with Charlie. Well, Walter helps her to see Charlie for what he really is. Her journey is one of self-discovery. At the beginning, Walter loves her very much and she barely sees him, but over the course of the film, she comes to realize his true worth, as well as her own, as they find one another.Can love make everything right? Unfortunately, some things are beyond its ability to heal, and the film has a bittersweet ending.It is a well-done adaptation of the novel, and even though it romanticizes their relationship at the end, I think I prefer the changes, which make a potentially depressing film into a sad one. It may not be action-packed--Maugham's stories seldom are--but it possesses a definite depth of character. Look for Toby Jones (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) as Waddington, the Englishman that becomes Kitty's confidante in a strange land.The cinematography is beautiful, and so is the music that is used in the soundtrack.I highly recommend this film if you enjoy such films as The English Patient.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the scenery?", "id": "c766083f600f1c30f2d577a4eafc5dfa", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I did enjoy this movie.

I am very happy that I did, it is worth the extra cost!The basic story of GHOST RIDER is that a young man gets cheated in a deal with the devil and must become the devil's bounty hunter, (while trying to figure out how to beat the devil at his own game).There are 13 extra minutes of movie time on this DVD, and at least half of it takes place during the origin scenes involving the teenaged Johnny Blaze (not the adult Johnny Blaze played by Nicolas Cage). This extra footage is just as enjoyable as any other portion of the teen scenes, and it really helps a lot to develop the characters more!I especially like the new scene when the young Johnny Blaze asks to ride his dad's favored motorcycle named \"Grace.\" \"Do you think you're man enough to ride Grace?\" \"Hell, yes!\" \"Well, I don't think so...\" Later his dad gives him the keys to Grace, to runaway with Roxanne, saying if he rides Grace he'll have a head start on his new life.Most of the other added minutes are short additions to already existing scenes, usually an extra line of dialog during conversations.I can only think of one scene where the new footage actually REPLACES original footage, (but still makes it better). In the saloon scene when Blackheart rounds up his spirit henchmen, originally one henchman asks, \"What about Mephistopheles?,\" and the scene ends with Blackheart replying that nobody may ever mention that name to him. In this improved EXTENDED CUT, instead of the question being asked, Mephistopheles himself shouts out for Blackheart to come outside the saloon to talk with him, and then there is the added scene of their discussion, which also helps to develop both characters better.I haven't really noticed any extra footage of the special effects Ghost Rider character himself, but the improved character development in all the other (mostly non-special effects) scenes is well worth the purchase of this EXTENDED CUT DVD, if you already know that you like this film, and even if you are seeing it for the first time with the EXTENDED CUT, you will have a better chance of liking it more.The Director's Commentary is excellent and informative. There is also a separate Producer's Commentary track, which is pretty good, too. One annoying story by the Producer is how he met actor Sam Elliott as a kid on a movie set, and is now \"paying him back\" for being so nice to him by giving Sam Elliott a role in GHOST RIDER. I think Sam Elliott could have gotten this gig all on his own, since he already had a major role in a Marvel Comics film, as General Ross in THE HULK movie, a few years back!Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)The EXTENDED CUT doesn't add much in the way of \"Making Of\" material. It adds about 20 minutes of poorly edited video touring the computer facilities where the computer effects are worked on, though the EXTENDED CUT DVD has a very enjoyable series of interview footage with comic book creators of the Ghost Rider character, that is very interesting and informative if you are into comic book history, like I am. This extra comic book interview material is separated by which decades are being discussed (mostly), 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s; each decade getting about 10+ minutes, totaling about 40 minutes. Writer/editor Roy Thomas starts the 1970s section with a brief history of the character dating back to the early 1950s, inspired by the original song, and as a cowboy ghost rider. This section could have been made better by having a PLAY ALL function, so you do have to hit play after viewing each decade, but if you like comics history then it will be worth it.I really enjoy this GHOST RIDER EXTENDED CUT DVD, and I think it is the best movie/DVD of 2007, in my opinion. GHOST RIDER is not as good as SPIDER-MAN 2, the best comic book movie ever, but I like this GHOST RIDER film better than 2007's overstuffed, underdeveloped SPIDER-MAN 3 film!Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)Perhaps this GHOST RIDER movie's biggest weakness is that sometimes the main character, as a special effect, looks a little stiff, but this improves as the film progresses. But this movie version is better than the comics version, especially since the movie's Johnny Blaze is tempted and tricked by the devil but does not seek the devil out, as opposed to the original Marvel Comics story where Johnny Blaze turns to his Satanic past history of studying devil worship and summons the devil to cut a deal, as can be seen in the Marvel Comics collection called THE ESSENTIAL GHOST RIDER, VOLUME 1.Essential Ghost Rider, Vol. 1 (Marvel Essentials)The best things about this movie are that the story is fun, funny, and interesting, and also that most of the characters and actors are very likable. I also really like the somewhat Biblical imagery and references, some more overtly obvious than others, (like when one character speaks the Bible verse, \"I am Legion, for we are many!,\" or when Johnny's dad tells him to ride Grace, being a writer's metaphor for the Grace of God, which the Bible says is mandatory for Christians to live by); and with my own past, I feel like I can relate to the Johnny Blaze character trying to beat the devil who dogs his every step, and trying to beat your own foolish deals with the devil in your past, to try to fight against the devil and look out for other people to not get hurt by the devil.I also like the way that this film takes it for granted that Hell and the devil exist, as opposed to most of our secular western culture that wants to pretend that there is no devil, no Hell, and no eternal punishment. Sure, this film gets it wrong that one must CHOOSE to sell your soul to the devil, (like most of our western culture also believes), despite that the Bible teaches that all are condemned to Hell unless they CHOOSE to follow Jesus! But GHOST RIDER's depictions of the devil, Hell, and evil spirits are a lot closer to Bible teachings than many popular heretics of today who claim to be Christians while denying the existence of Hell, the devil, and that the Bible teaches of the existence of these things!", "qas": [{"question": "Is a funny movie?", "id": "d83ae44f2939200fb7801f0f6754dc4c", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000QGDY06", "paragraphs": [{"context": "'Premonition' is a suspense film that scores a little low on the suspense-o-meter.

Then Jim dies in a car accident, leaving Linda trying to cope with her loss.But, when she wakes up the next morning, Jim is alive again, just like his death never happened.

I know, I'm out of the loop, but thank goodness I found this gem in Ratatouille. Never had I been so brought back to the joys of childhood where I could watch a movie and have it bring about so many forms of sheer joy and innocent emotion and feel like I actually was a kid again. But at the same time, I found a very subtle maturity to the story and characters of this movie as well. The amazement of cooking and food, the exotic backdrop of Paris, the silly, yet serious interactions of a rat and his handler, then the denouement of a hard-nosed food critic who rediscovered himself and reasserted the happiness of which only food can do to a person; all of these elements make for a very light-hearted comedy about what it means to find something in life that you can dedicate yourself to, pursue, and enjoy to your heart's content. In particular, I was every impressed with the script and screenplay. Remy's conscience being played by an imaginary version of Gusteau was brilliant in studying his overall character as the audience gets a clear, basic understanding of what Remy is thinking to himself. Linguini is a \"lovable loser\" archetype that tries so hard, but always manages to bumble things. There's a sort of coyness that makes him fun to root for and his \"ambitions\" are commendable, kind of like an \"everyman,\" so I really enjoyed watching him as well. Then, there are all of the other supporting characters in Chef Skinner, Anton Ego, Collette, Remy's family, etc. that ultimately make the film one very enjoyable experience. Top that off with a great soundtrack by Michael Giacchino who captures much of the same exoticism that makes Paris so intriguing, and you've got this lovely Oscar-wining feature.Video - 5.0Being a direct digital transfer of CG to BD, the result is flawless. Colors are vibrant with lots of yellows and golds accentuating the color palette of the kitchen at Gusteau's. Black levels and contrast are perfect in revealing all the fine detailed lines from the hugeness of Linguini's nose down to the tiny hairs and whiskers of Remy and his clan. Images are always sharp, and the image itself provides for some great example of depth and dimensionality. There are no signs of aliasing, color banding, or any other hiccups making for some beautiful shots of photography amongst the backdrop of Paris, and even some of the inner housing of Linguini's apartment, the kitchen, and the sewers. There also appear to be no signs of artificial enhancement or manipulation, making this a transfer as perfect as you can get and ready to be showcased for all.Audio - 5.0Using an uncompressed PCM 5.1 track, Ratatouille is equally as stunning as it's video counterpart. Dialogue is clear, and directionality is particularly precise during kitchen scenes with the clanging of pots and pans, whooshing of flames, and dribbles of liquid all over the place. Music accompanies the sound effects perfectly and immerses the viewer with some wonderful and adventurous melodies that really compliment the story telling, never overdoing itself or intruding over the dialogue. LFEs are most prominent during musical numbers and when things are being chopped up. There really are no flaws with the general sound design and placement and should be enjoyable by the ears of any.Extras - 4.5Personally, I found the extras to be very fun and informative. But the only gripe I have is that they didn't put the \"making of\" featurettes on as separate 25GB disc by itself. Instead of SD specials, they could've well been HD. Other than that, though, they're all very enjoyable. The Pixar animated shorts are always a nice addition, while the \"rat history\" as narrated by Remy and Emile served as a cute parody of how rats could be thought of under a different light (not that it'll ever happen since rats aren't as smart as this, but the effort is appreciated). Then of course there's the production segments, which continue to amaze me in how hard it really is to produce films of this caliber. I highly respect and give thanks to all the people involved in these types of projects.Overall - 5.0The only thing that would've made this release any better is an extra disc specifically reserved for the special features. But other than that, it's an extreme delight to have watched this film for its cheery and lovable narrative about personal passion and the following of one's dreams. With immaculate A/V quality and an excellent set of extras and special features, I can't recommend this title enough for both kids and adults.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the color of this film?", "id": "14ad9edf25d21271213d6704a5338522", "answers": [{"text": "Colors are vibrant with lots of yellows and golds accentuating the color palette of the kitchen at Gusteau's.

It doesn't. It captures the LOOK of the '60s brilliantly, but otherwise, it's a caricature of that era. EVERY male character is a despicable, philandering, sexist pig who leads a pathetically empty life devoid of real meaning. Every suburban scene positively drips with the implication that these people all live utterly superficial, meaningless, shallow, phony lives, wearing polite smiles that they show each other, even as they connive and gossip maliciously behind each others' backs. And no one, but NO ONE is actually happy.  Every man and woman walks through life like a robot, doing what's expected and appropriate, and all secretly unhappy and unfulfilled.  There are no characters who really like their jobs, no husbands and fathers who truly love their wives and children, no wives who are genuinely happy to be raising their kids because they love them and love motherhood, etc.  What we seem to have here is an overreaction to the classic \"Leave It To Beaver\" or \"Father Knows Best\" view of life presented in the shows of this era.  If those shows over-sanitized life and presented a too idealized vision of American life, then I think this one goes too far in the other direction, and tries to make life back then look stylish and sharp on the surface, but totally rotten, corrupt, cheap, and ugly underneath.  The truth almost certainly lies somewhere in between.Take a look at how people behave on this show.  While I'm sure sexism and sexual harassment were a bit worse back then, it simply couldn't have been THIS bad. In one scene, in the first episode, one of the young executives looks a new girl up and down like a piece of meat, and then proceeds to offer gratuitous and explicit criticism of her her appearance and advice on how to sex herself up, right to her face. Come on! Sexual harassment was, as I said, probably worse back then, but this is outrageously rude behavior by ANY standard, and I know that simple good manners and politeness did exist back then.  The same character then asks this girls boss when he can have his turn with her, as though it simply goes without saying that she'll sleep with him; it's just a regular perk that goes along with the job, like having a key to the executive washroom.  Later on, another male character, who hasn't been so crude, spends a little time building rapport with this same girl, and she's glad to meet someone who appears genuinely nice and friendly.  And then the next thing you know, he gets her in an office, locks the door, and tries to start taking her clothes off.  Message loud and clear: he's just like all the rest.  Now really, was there ever a time when ALL men just took it for granted that every attractive woman was available and willing, and any woman who is nice to a guy will just roll onto her back for him at the first opportunity?  I don't think so.And the writer's portrayal of racism, and classism is every bit as much a caricature as their portrayal of sexism.  This show is stylish, the dialogue is smartly written, the actors' performances are top notch, and the production values are superb.  The show recaptures the appearance of the early 1960s brilliantly.  But the treatment of how people lived and worked and acted is not nearly so well done.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the set?", "id": "d761b95901252bd8df8578b4d28f66dd", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B000YABYLA", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I really enjoyed this film.

Instead, he finds oil.  Years later, he has a team working for him to pump the oil.  When one of that team is killed in an accident, Daniel takes the man's son as his own.  By 1912, Daniel is a well-known oil man.  He follows up a lead in California, only to find himself at odds with the evangelist preacher Eli Sunday (Dano).  Sunday wants $10,000 for the church before he sells the land.  After a contract is signed, Daniel reneges on the deal, and the church is left without the money.  An enemy is formed.  As Daniel continues his rise in the oil industry, the more corrupt he becomes.\"There Will Be Blood\" is a fascinating character study.  Daniel is many things: friendly, ruthless, kind, violent, manipulative, and charismatic.  He knows how to get what he wants, and rises from nothing into a wealthy businessman.  Daniel Day Lewis is excellent in this part and is the film's biggest selling point.  He makes a long movie pass quickly.  The film itself is fascinating, showing the rise and fall of an oil tycoon.

He achieves a bit of both actually in this terribly endearing Seventies-feel Sci-Fi schlock fest.First up, Darabont cleverly doesn't go for big names in the lead roles - there are faces in there you'll recognize (William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn - who were both in the mighty \"Shawshank Redemption\" for instance), but it's mostly actors you vaguely know or don't recognize at all. It has the effect of making their predicament more real - ordinary townsfolk locked into a battle for survival - where common sense quickly takes a back seat and bravery becomes a luxury few are willing to deploy...Here how it goes - the Army's been experimenting up in the mountains (aren't they always) and have unleashed something nasty on our world (don't they always). As the 'mist' creeps in over a small US town after an unnatural storm, half the not-so-bright populace gets trapped in the local supermarket where it becomes quickly evident that it's probably not a good idea to go outside into the dense creeping fog, because people who do tend to either not come back or get eaten. Ropes that were attached to torsos - fall limp, there's a sound; a scream and someone's entrails end up on the potato chips stand...(thoughtless of them you have to say)...All the usual elements are in place - the irritating stupid ones who do something they shouldn't and end up as fodder, the lying Army types covering their uniformed asses, the wise old ones who sacrifice for the young, the cowardly big talkers who then sit in corners and whinge - the women who are ballsier and brainier than the men - all manner of parents who are just trying to protect their families...the resourcefulness and guts of those who do fight back and win...Darabont also cleverly ratchets up the tension by having no music for ages so that when the sinister synth drone does kick in - it really kicks in - and when the wailing vocals of Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance on \"The Host of Seraphim\" comes in towards the end - it has the emotional impact of a fist in the face. It's on an album called (not surprisingly) \"The Serpent's Egg\"...Toby Jones is superb as the grounded Supermarket owner, Thomas Jane as the father who must keep safe his son at all costs and Andre Braugher as his difficult neighbour who doesn't buy into the hysteria and conspiracy theories and pays the webbed price.But the film belongs to Marcia Gay Harden who is stunningly effective as the town's religious zealot who seizes her it's-the-wrath-of-God moment with non-stop apocalyptical-jabbering. Of course after two days of ranting about sins and the End of the World and her being God's conduit, she begins to make twisted sense to the terrified folks desperate to placate the beasties outside. Enter the inevitable Lord Of The Flies scenario - a sacrifice must be made...There's something terribly old-fashioned about The Mist. It wants to make your girlfriend go \"yew!\" a lot and it achieves this on several occasions with genuinely squeamish aplomb. Coming over a bit like an Irwin Allen Seventies epic, The Mist is basically a very, very good B-movie.For Blu Ray owners - the special effect creatures are Jurassic Park meets Alien meets the bug scene in King Kong - creepy, scary and deliciously icky. The Blu Ray images are really clean and crisp and even when huge things lurk over cars in a blurry haze, you still see their monstrous outlines and 'feel' their size as the pumped-up audio does its thing. The 'black and white' version on Disc 2 is even creepier and a very clever addition.By the time the unexpected and staggeringly downbeat ending finally comes (some have truly hated this though) - you know someone has done their job right, because you've been rightly and royally entertained. And more importantly - you've rooted for these people - so much so that you end up thinking about them and their decisions - days later...Recommended.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the people film?", "id": "a7603f8bd50e88b34239ef7d88699cea", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00111YM5Q", "paragraphs": [{"context": "'30 Days Of Night' has a good premise, great setting and solid special FX, but it's a poorly executed film!

Abrams (creator of LOST, my all-time favorite TV drama). I watched roughly two thirds of the first season (until about February) and decided to exclude it from my weekly TV \"regimen\". Though some episodes were very interesting and entertaining, most others felt like fillers that weren't really leading anywhere. Plus, even the \"cannon\" material didn't really get off the ground. It was kind of like watching The X-Files without any mythology...it would be decent, but nowhere near special.However, as a recent Christmas gift, I was given the entire first season on DVD and prodded to begin where I had left off with the promise that the show would begin to blow my mind. I reluctantly agreed, as once I cast away a show I usually don't return, and picked up on the 14th (of 20) episode entitled \"Ability\". Within a few days, I was quickly finished with this season and scrambling to catch up on Season Two before it returns to the air!Basically, the show is about the aptly-named \"Fringe\" division of the F.B.I., including three main participants:Walter Bishop, a once-deranged scientist, now somewhat (!) sane, who conducted crazy physics experiments in his younger years that come into play nearly every week.Peter Bishop, son of Walter, who seems to just blend into the background at times but may, as Season Two rolls along, just turn out to be the most fascinating character of the whole show.Olivia Dunham, lead FBI investigator, who not only does the field work but also is tied to the Bishops due to strange happenings in her childhood.This Fringe division investigates an abundance of strange/paranormal events that comes to be known as \"The Pattern\", which (in the early goings) all seems to point to the uber-company Massive Dynamic (led by the shadowy Nina Sharp). The goal is to determine why these freakish events keep occurring and discover their source.As I mentioned earlier, the first two thirds of this plotline never really get off the ground. Peter is more annoying than anything, Walter is just a nut, and Sharp's Massive Dynamics isn't developed enough to really hook you in. Plus, Dunham is more preoccupied with communicating with her murdered FBI partner John Scott than with anything that the Bishops have to offer. However, once the Scott storyline is put to rest and the ZFT/William Bell angle is picked up on in \"Ability\", that is when the show goes from borderline to incredible. The characters become much more human, the plot will have you hanging at every turn, and the sheer brilliance of the writing will astound you.Think of it this way...it is like a combination of the X-Files mythology (although even more interesting and better thought-out), the heavy physics concepts from Season Five of LOST, and even the Stephen King \"there are other worlds than these\" concept that spawned the incredibly popular \"Dark Tower\" books.Thus, I urge you to PLEASE not give up on this show until you have watched the entire thing. It starts slow and looks to be wallowing around for awhile, but (I guess) never should we doubt the mind of Mr. Abrams. The final scene of the season?

In light of expectations (high) it is probably better than most people (including myself) give it credit for, but not by that much.This adventure, that finds Anakin Skywalker being paired up with his new Padawan Ahsoka Tano, lacks the compelling emotional characters that can make a fantasy film fun or great.  I think that Anakin here is better than Hayden Christensen's version when speaking of emotional depth and characterization but he's still not the engendering of a hero at this point and the Kenobi mentors Skywalker mentors Tano balancing act, while not hindering the characters, just falls flat and that's too bad because that's where this film could have been really fun and moving toward good (rather than just okay).  As it often seems Obi Wan Kenobi is given the ability to be the emotional and mental balance of the film and his poised confidence remains the nucleus around what all of the other characters can look to and draw from (Ahsoka is fine as the new Padawan, not irritating or ingratiating, and you do root for her but she's not allowed to develop into her own).My main complaint with the movie is that I find the Hutts an irritating lot, whether it's Rotta (Jabba's sluggy offspring) or Ziro (who sounded like a wheezy Isabel Sanford from the Jeffersons).

After delivering last summer's endearing \"Wall-e\", they've again upped (no pun intended) the ante and created another animated masterpiece that will appeal to children and adults alike.The story follows Carl, who as a young man, dreamt of great adventure. This love led him to his wife, Ellie, who like Carl, fantasized about a faraway place in South America. As on old man and now without his beloved wife, Carl faces the loss of his home, the one connection to his wife, and being forced into a retirement community. When Carl is finally pushed to the brink and makes a bad decision, the courts decide its time for him to be placed in a nursing home. Carl, however, has other plans and, unknowingly with a persistent boy named Russell in tow, floats away toward the site that his childhood hero visited in his great exploits. Once there, Carl quickly finds out that his hero is not all he was cracked up to be and must find a way to safely return Russell and himself home.This little film, like \"Wall-e\", is one of the most charming and touching in the Disney/Pixar pantheon.  Comparable to \"Wall-e\" with its environmental message, this movie also delivers an important commentary about friendship and the importance of living life to its fullest. There are several scenes that are sure to tug at your heart strings but also enough laughs and action to keep the little ones happy. The characters are rich and well developed---Carl, a loveable old curmudgeon (voiced by Ed Asner) and Russell, a sweet kid who needs a paternal influence in his life. My favorite character is Doug, a \"talking\" dog, who's dialogue is exactly what you would picture a dog saying if they could really speak. I think he will be the Dory or Jack-Jack of this film, well loved and received by young and old.As usual, Pixar's animation is a feast for the eyes, full of beautiful, bold colors and crisp imagery that compliments the various locales that the adventuresome duo visit.

Many of us have been waiting for this moment for years, some for even decades.  But despite the bumps along the ways, and fears that we may never see its realization, us fans finally have what we have wanted for so long.  I'm talking, of course, about Joss Whedon's first time helming an existing property in a major motion picture.  As much as Whedon fans have enjoyed his original work over the years, many of us have wondered what he could do not only with preexisting characters but also with the backing of a major budget and the epic panoramic screen of the multiplex.  Oh, and of course the film itself happens to be The Avengers, the most anticipated movie of the last ten years or so.  And I'm happy to report that no one other than Whedon would have been able to pull off a film with this scope and this huge cast of characters.As you might guess, this review will be Whedon centric.  Plenty of people have dissected The Avengers from the point of view of comic book fans or critics of summer blockbusters.  But I would like to approach it from the perspective of one entry within Whedon's larger oeuvre.  I have a long history with Whedon's work, starting in high school when I first started watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on a lark.  The concept of transforming a poorly received film into an ongoing series appeared to be such an idiotic idea that I decided to tune in order to witness some schadenfreude.  But eventually I found myself sucked into the story of a group of teenagers struggling simultaneously with adolescents and the supernatural, both elements of the show serving as metaphor for the other.  Not only did Buffy provide a surprisingly accurate view of growing up, but it also dipped into narrative experimentation.  Like many TV shows from the 90s, Buffy was acutely aware of genre conventions and subverted them whenever it could.  From then on I was a devoted fan of Whedon's work, from his spin off series Angel to the cult classic Firefly to his work in comic books.And of all the elements Whedon is most known for, the one that makes him most suited for an Avengers film is his ability to handle a large cast of characters without letting anyone slide into the background.  Whedon once said that he had to add more characters to Angel because he had such a difficult time writing for just the three principle actors.  It's also not uncommon for ancillary characters to become series regulars in his shows.  So if anyone is capable of balancing out four superheroes who had previously anchored their own films along with a good helping of backup characters, it is Joss Whedon.  The Avengers combines elements from many of the previous films.  The Iron Man movies initially introduced the idea of \"The Avengers Initiative,\" first in a post-credit scene from the first film and later in the sequel SHIELD and the Avengers served as an entire subplot that nearly derailed the movie.  The MacGuffin, here known as the tesseract, was first introduced in Captain America and has a connection to the Norse Gods that filled out the mythology of Thor.  And the main villain, Loki, is of course the adopted brother of Thor himself.  Of all the previous Marvel movies, The Incredible Hulk is the least essential.  But with a new casting (Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton) audiences have an opportunity to become reacquainted with the green guy.The basic plot of the film is relatively straight forward with only a few curves thrown in for good measure.  Loki wants to steal the tesseract so that he can lead an invading alien force that will take over the Earth.  Without too much plot to get in the way, Whedon is capable of focusing his energy on the story's core pith: the friction between the heroes.  A lot of the film's drama comes from the fact that these characters don't belong together.  Their personalities and ideologies just don't fit.  In most comic books this means that the heroes have to fight before they team up, and in true comic book form when Thor tries to extract Loki from SHIELD custody and take him back to Asgardian jurisdiction Captain America and Iron Man team up to stop him.  Likewise, Captain America, who is a man out of time, continually brushes up against Tony Stark.  This makes sense, since Steve Rogers is a veteran of World War II when it was necessary for the individuals to sacrifice himself for the greater good, but, as Iron Man, Tony Stark doesn't do anything without first considering his own ego.  And in the midst of all this tension lies Bruce Banner who is liable to Hulk out at any provocation.Whedon is able to steer the film towards the interpersonal thanks to a few tricks he learned back in his Buffy days.  In the episode, \"The Yoko Factor,\" the gang captures the punk rock vampire Spike only for him to psychologically manipulate each of Buffy's friends in order to get them to turn on one another.  The point of the episode is that these tensions have existed for some time, and it only took a little spark for all of the resentment between friends to ignite into hatred.  Similarly, in The Avengers, Shield manages to capture Loki who then proceeds to sew seeds of distrust among the newly formed super group.  By making the tensions between the Avengers a weakness the villain can exploit, Whedon is able to clearly illustrate these characters for the audience while keeping the plot moving along.  The story doesn't need to stop in order for us to get to know these characters.If Whedon is known for one authorial tick, then it is probably his use of witticisms and word play.  The team dynamic allows him plenty of space to incorporate some of his well known dialogue.  The film trades in lots of quips between heroes and has a sprinkling of snark without going overboard.  Critics of Whedon's writing find his dialogue to be treacly rather than charming, and while I mostly disagree with these critics, it's certainly true that not all of Whedon's verbal jabs land properly.  This is especially true when Whedon isn't present to carefully direct his dialogue's delivery (see Halle Berry in The X-Men).  But like an athlete who does his best work in front of millions, here, when the world is watching, Whedon's humor absolutely shines.  And he has found a great ally in Robert Downey Jr. who is known to insist on making his own improvements on his scripts (the \"Shwarma\" joke was apparently all his idea).  In fact, Whedon is confident enough in his humor to momentarily take a break from the action to show us a Shield agent playing Galaga on a multimillion dollar computer when his boss isn't watching.  A joke that wouldn't work if he didn't trust that his audience shared his own bizarre sense of humor.In addition to his use of repartee, Whedon's also well known as a pop culture feminist, which in practice means he likes to watch an attractive lady beat up guys much bigger than herself.  Here Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) serves this particular purpose.  Several times throughout the film, Black Widow uses others' perception of her as an emotionally fragile creature in order to, jujitsu-like, convince her enemies to spill important information.  What might be first seen as a weakness becomes a weapon.  Whedon is clearly within the ideological confines of third-wave feminism, which seems to maintain that women can both serve as sexual objects while simultaneously kicking ass.  And there's some legitimate criticism to this approach to feminism, but Whedon generally gets away with it because he's able to write strong, interesting female characters.  We learn that Black Widow has a history with another SHIELD agent, Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner and, unfortunately, not given much of a role).  And when he is taken by Loki, Black Widow, in a role reversal, is allowed to become his savior.  Third wave feminism suits Johansson, an actress who most directors seem unable to do anything interesting with.  Arguably, this is her best role since Lost in Translation.But if there is a single major theme of The Avengers, then it is the question of the place of the individual within a larger community.  While making a pit stop in Germany, Loki takes the time to make a crowd of people bow before him while he pontificates on the useless notion of freedom.  And if the parallels between Loki's philosophy and fascism aren't clear enough, an older gentleman in the crowd decides to stand up and all but call Loki Hitler (obviously this fellow has never heard of Godwin's Law).  But the Avengers have their own problems formulating a cohesive group.  Each character is in some manner or other cut off from the larger society, whether it is Bruce Banner's rage or Tony Stark's ego.  These are individuals who are marked as outsiders, a favorite theme of Whedon's work.  But their very survival, and the survival of the world, is dependant on the ability of these individual parts to interlock.  Whedon represents the eventual coming together of these heroes in the final battle with a single shot that moves around the city in order to let the audience see how these characters work together as a cohesive unit.  For Whedon the answer to forced unity is not pure individuality, but rather a volatile mixture of the singular within the communal.But Whedon hasn't lost his healthy distrust of governing bodies.  Without giving too much away, in addition to dealing with an alien invasions, the film's heroes must also contend with the unclear motives of SHIELD, the quasi-military/quasi-intelligence agency that first assembled the Avengers.  Not only do members of the Avengers accuse SHIELD of attempting to create weapons of mass destruction, but the organization also purposefully attacks a civilian target for the \"greater good.\"  In fact, Whedon's portrayal of SHIELD may have been too subversive for the U.S. military who cited its portrayals as a reason why they refused to cooperate with the movie by lending military equipment, an offer they regularly extend to films that represent the armed forces in a much more \"patriotic\" light.For the most part the movies produced by Marvel have been, by necessity, studio films in the classic Hollywood tradition.  Superhero movies have become so popular that most studios have banished any ultra stylistic auteurs who, early on in the superhero craze, put out some of the more distinctive films in the genre.  The likes of Ang Lee and Sam Raimi were deemed too idiosyncratic to helm multi-million dollar films.  That doesn't mean that there haven't been some interesting superhero films in the last few years, but it does mean that singular visions have been replaced by the work of handy craftsmen.  When you watch Tim Burton's Batman, you immediately recognize that this can be nothing but the work of Tim Burton The same could be said about Nolan's Batman series, thanks to the fact that they were first made when superhero auteurs were still in vogue.  (It's unlikely in today's environment that the studio would give Nolan as much free reign as he wielded).  Joss Whedon's The Avengers (a title that would make more sense than Marvel's The Avengers) attempts to derail this trend.  While Whedon is still constrained by the visual and narrative template established previously in earlier Marvel movies, he still manages to create a film that speaks with his own artistic voice.  This is especially impressive when you consider the fact that he was entrusted with an astronomical budget.  Maybe from within the deafening confines of the studio system, a singular voice can make itself heard after all.", "qas": [{"question": "How is your standard?", "id": "6ac8b641be413f1c1378998cbea64cc0", "answers": [{"text": "the Avengers", "answer_start": 2870}]}]}, {"context": "This isn't bad for a summer big action film. It has a good fast pace, a simple story and a sense of humor about itself. The action is very creative and, as expected, Robert Downey Jr steals the show. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job in a rather subdued role. The Harry Dean Stanton cameo was very well done and shows that he still has it as a character actor.The bits with Scarlett Johansson were creative and fun. They turned the usual \"weak hero getting lectured by the villian\" bit on its head. That sort of thing is the best method for putting a heroic character over in a film. The villian gets his bluster lines, but then is shown to have been outsmarted and ends up looking foolish. Few films (for decades) have managed to get that simple thing right. The actors playing Thor and Captain America also did a good job. The bit with Loki in Europe established the Captain America character in a good way in a short amount of film time and avoided what could have been the annoying aspects of a lecturing patriotic character. Thor was all about the action as it should have been. They managed to figure out a way to make the Hawkeye character (an archer) actually work. The bits with the bow as a close-up weapon were a great idea.The things that don't work so well:Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury however doesn't work. There is too much of him and I dont know that using him to bring the group together in the story was necessary. It would have been better for him to be more incidental than constantly at the core of things. The whole the-government-can't-be-trusted subplot was a predictable waste of time.They spent too much time with followup characters from previous films. It didn't add much of anything really.The alien invasion characters were all rather bland and cookie cutter looking. Making everything grey chrome and mostly identical was a rather odd choice. It got to a point where it seemed like there were two CGI models that they just kept using over and over again. It might have been better to give some of the aliens more of a personality rather than having them be bugs squashed one after the other.Five stars within its genre.

Not that there is anything wrong with the actual film. Far from it. But by its very nature, it has insurmountable obstacles which would automatically deminish its potential, despite anything anyone might do with it.For one thing, if you ever were a fan of the Marvel comic books, you know that this time out you are seeing is a once-a-year annual edition, rather than a regular story. In any regular issue the story would focus on one particular plot or threat or through-line and the struggle to overcome that single problem allowed the characters to explore various aspects of their lives and personalities. In the Annual issue, the entire idea was to cram it as full of \"neat stuff\" as possible, rather than tell a linear story. It was in the annual's that such fan questions as \"if Hulk met Thor, who would win?\" got addressed, not as some necessary part of the main plotline, but just for fun. And that's what goes on here... the fun.Basically it's an almost three hour long fireworks show. It's amazing, thrilling, even mind-blowing. But after a while, fireworks, no matter how individually impressive, are still just fireworks. A couple hours into the show, you're going to experience shell shock and your ability to react emotionally is going to shut down. That's what happens in Avengers. You just never get all that emotionally involved, simply because there's so much going on, so much action, so many complex relationships, that it's overkill. All you really do is buckle in for the numerous action sequences, and those are absolute gold.I found two other flaws with the film, however.From time to time, it didn't seem to be able to decide if it wanted to be taken seriously, to make the crises genuinely moving, or it just wanted to be a wacky cartoon. Joss (as writer/director) makes a couple of poor choices with moments that could have helped pull the audience in emotionally, totally sabotaguing them. One example is late in the film where Hulk and Thor are banging away at each other, then join together to take on a massive alien flying worm creature, succeeding in killing it. But at the moment where it crashes to the ground and dies, leaving the two heroes atop its body in triumph, Joss chose to throw in a sight gag (Hulk punching Thor sideways) that is clearly out of a Warner Brothers cartoon. So a moment where we might have seen a bit of some kind of bonding between these battling characters is totally shattered in favor of a cheap, quick laugh. There are a number of those moments throughout the film that slap against any possibility of trying to take things emotionally seriously.The other weakness is the early sniping the heroes do at each other. Although it is intended to show that they are loners, egocentric and unable to bond into a cohesive unit, the dialogue is actually so witty, clever and engaging, that it all comes off like a group of friends playing \"the Dozens\" (that game where you hurl insults at one another.) There is no sense that these guys can't get along, or that there is any dangerous tension between them. It reads a lot more like Bing Crosby/Bob Hope banter in one of their Road pictures. Not that it's bad in any way. It's brilliant dialogue, heaps of fun to watch. But supposedly one of the main dramatic themes is the very \"loner\" nature of these characters and their inability to work together. At no time do you get a sense that, if one of them pushes a single inch further all hell is going to break loose, and that is what is needed to drive home the point... the Avengers were rejected by the Powers That Be because they can't work together effectively. Even a very few moments where those confrontations really looked like things were going to break into violence due to egos or annoyance would have adequetly reinforced that necessary sense that the Avengers are not going to work as a team, but no such moments exist because Joss's writing is just too darn good and engaging.Other than those few weaknesses, more a product of the very basic nature and sheer size of the piece, the Avengers is a high concept romp through a theme park of thrills. Since I first saw it three days ago, I've watched it four times, always finding tiny little additional nuggets to enjoy each time. This is one to buy and keep in the DVD jukebox rotation.One final comment. If Joss set out to make every guy in the audience fall hopelessly in love with Gweneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, he succeeded. The by-play between her and Stark when Agent Coulson comes by is absolute bliss.

Warner who owns DC comics did this as well, even though they own the rights. You would think having all these characters together in one movie and give them all enough screen time would be hard, but Whedon who is a comic book fan pulls it off..The movie has great action, humor and looks great, I would recommend seeing all the other movies first if you haven't yet. Iron Man,The Incredible Hulk,Thor and Captain America in order. Even if your not a comic book fan I think your going to enjoy this film.I only had two complaints with Avengers.1.Them replacing Ed Norton with Mark Ruffalo, granted Ruffalo did a great job in the role, I just always had a pet peeve when Hollywood replaces main actors with someone different in sequels etc. For me it just messes with the flow,especially if they look nothing alike, again it is a minor complaint when you see how great the movie is it works.2.

The deleted scene answered the question for me.The movie on Blu ray looks great, and was an excellent transfer.

I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that madeIron Man(1 & 2),The Incredible Hulk(the 2008 version),Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerpurely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable.  A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in \"Thor\") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in \"Iron Man 2\", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.)  For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life.

Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper,Mamma Mia!) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, \"Look at them. To be that free.\" His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the set enough reason to watch the movie?", "id": "2ef18210ba2d06c78721ed605918a2bf", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B001MVYUQQ", "paragraphs": [{"context": "QUARANTINEAngela is a reporter who is working a story on a local fire department; she is having fun but is looking to go out on a call.

The only previous Emmerich films I'd seen prior to this were Independence Day and Godzilla. Given my limited experience to his work, but with remnants of nostalgia from ID4 (loved it as a kid), I went in expecting this same kind of formula: an element of doom that threatens humanity (malevolent aliens, or in this case the end of the world), people uniting in response to that threat (after the damage had already been done, of course), and in the process exposing humanity's faults for what they are, therefore, eliminating our differences and bringing us closer together as a people. I caught on to this back in the theater, but naivety got the best of me and I think my change in tastes over the years (it's been about a decade since I've seen either of those movies) has caused me to over-analyze Emmerich's latest film. To be blunt, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. The cheese, campiness, ostentatious melodrama, and writing problems bugged me. Now? I don't think it's as bad as before. Despite this movie being a little longer than I'd like, I actually found some very profound themes on a subsequent viewing: mortality (how we take life for granted), selflessness (or vice versa, if you look at all the snobbery throughout some of the characters), and just the very fact of how disconnected we are as a species (which Emmerich tries to build through the many, many characters and their relationships throughout the film, but never really succeeds in fleshing out). The special effects are spiffy and I'm really starting to like Chiwetel Ejiofor as an actor. Maybe I found these themes by accident, but turning my mind to \"popcorn mode\" actually made said themes a little more impacting overall. With that said, these themes are still too unfocused than can make up for all the cheese and \"fun,\" but I can say I actually like the movie at least a little more than I disliked it before. If I had to summarize the movie, I'd say \"go popcorn, but expect a few surprises.\"Video - 4.5Sony presents us with an excellent 1080p picture in an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 framed at 2.39. Colors are especially prominent and diverse throughout the film ranging from very accurate skin tones to lush landscape views and, of course, meteorological destruction. This is complimented by outstanding contrast levels making explosions, smoke, and all that other CG anarchy look flawless. Black levels are also handled near-perfectly, though I think I saw a little color banding through some of the darker-lit scenes. Sharpness, details, textures, and line delineation are also spot-on, adding a great sense of depth and HD pop to the film's presentation. Water during the tsunami scenes in particular stand out to me the most and, despite the weak writing, are amazing to look at from a visual and aesthetic point of view. All the crumbling buildings, fireballs, and earth-splitting are certainly a sight to behold. If at least not for the corresponding reference audio, this is a demo-worthy disc to showcase your HD home theaters for video as well. Which brings me to...Audio - 5.0These days in Hollywood, mayhem usually begets a very strong and active sound field. 2012 is no exception to that as Sony's DTS-HD 5.1 track is every bit as frenetic and chaotic as what you're seeing on the screen. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Grinding gravel, shattering glass, the rumbling earth, molten lava, gargantuan tidal waves, vehicle engines, and every other discernible sound effect add an extra level of realism that make the special effects so much more enjoyable. The sub-woofer stays relatively quiet pre-Apocalypse, but when that crust displacement thing starts kicking in, you'll be happy to know that sub you bought is earning its money's worth. Dialogue also stays clear throughout the entire film, never losing consistency in volume level. Separation of said dialogue and all the special effects noises are never a problem either, with directionality giving a very spacious feeling to said destruction all across the sound board. Again, like the video, this would make an especially good reference BD to wow and showcase to your friends.Extras - 3.5As much as I like to give commentaries a listen for whatever kind of extra information on production or writing that they have, I'm going to be honest and say I don't think I have it in me to sit through this movie two more times for both a P-i-P and audio commentary track. After watching the standalone featurettes on disc 2, I find Roland Emmerich to be something of a paradox. He seems like a very detail-attentive director who takes pride in his craft; that craft for this particular movie being a spiffy visual feast of destruction, mayhem, and a sort of child-like imagination in the way those ideas come to fruition. However, unlike a Michael Bay or Jon Turteltaub who both possess that \"big kid director\" kind of approach to movie-making, I feel Emmerich lacks in general enthusiasm as a whole, at least that's the feeling I got from the interviews here. And to sit through two and a half hours of that blandness twice is just not something I'd rather use my free time for. That being said, I give Sony a lot of credit for putting these extras together. A good majority of them focus a lot on production and the ego of Emmerich and his \"master technique\" for making epic disaster films (of which only one really stands out to me at this time), while the rest of the features are tied into the whole Mayan Calender and impending Apocalypse craze. I found these parts to be interesting at some points, but then blatantly insulting at others. For a movie about the end of the world that supposedly uses scientific \"truth\" and reasoning for a believable premise, the \"experts\" interviewed here are more than adamant to the point of either saying \"it could happen,\" or as that one scientist said \"it will happen [and that I've been right all along because this movie is so well-crafted by Emmerich, how can it not be the truth?].\" On top of that, he goes on to use the excuse that the reason most regular people won't believe his theory is because of a subconscious defense to the \"fear\" that our lives will, indeed, end when he says it will according to the Mayan Calender. Take from these segments what you will, but after such a brazen display in ideological put-downs that nearly defeated the purpose of the movie for me, I have to say it's a strange array of extras that gets an A in effort, but a C in continuity and bias.Overall - 4.0I didn't like the film so much the first time around, but was surprised upon a repeat viewing. For me, I like movies that manage to have a little bit of everything: good production values, an engaging story and/or characters that, when aptly put together, make for some semblance of entertainment or thought-provocation, and a good cast of actors/actresses. 2012, while on the extremely high end of production values, also has a surprising amount profundity with more or less cookie-cutter archetypal characters, though with a good performance by one Chiwetal Ejiofor. Consequently, the presence of many an absurdity represented by some of the supporting/unnecessary characters, cheesy screenplay, silly script, and unfocused attention to some of the finer details in the writing ruin what could've made this a much more fulfilling and epic Apocalypse film. I wish I could say this is more than another popcorn flick and a definite must-own title outside of its reference A/V presentation, but I consider this a rental at best. However, if you're happy enough with the popcorn mentality and aren't bothered by some of the movie's faults, then this is definitely worth adding to your collection.", "qas": [{"question": "How many dimensions does the character have?", "id": "41a083319d5e9df9964c280e963227cb", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B001OQCV6A", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This movie was a great way to start off the series.

The actors did the best they could with the muddle of a script and the bad directing from Guy--if the story gets boring, throw in a fight and some property damage--Ritchie (whose films I used to enjoy). And the dialogue was unintelligible at several points in the film. If I can understand Monty Python, I can understand any British accent. It wasn't the accents, it was the mumbling of the actors and the pacing of the story. Maybe Ritchie figured he could make the story more exciting (good luck) by speeding up the dialogue.

Of course, with this much CGI being used in the film, grain would not occur in the first place.  Contrast is excellent and the usually cooler color temperature grading of the film during many of the action sequences adds to the film's ambience.  Details are quite easy to see even in the darker, more shadowy areas despite the fact that the editors crushed the blacks in many places.  You really can't have a cleaner transfer than what you are getting here despite a fairly low Mbps average usually in the low twenties.AUDIO....Audio has always been as important to me as the video quality and I know that is not the case for everyone.  The audio is a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 codec.  I wish it were a 7.1 channeled surround but it isn't.  There is an early scene when Watson is walking into Holme's office which is full of birds and other animals masked by all the foliage.  During this scene there is fantastic use of bird foley fx that make the most of discreet directionality from your front and rear surrounds.  For the rest of the film the music score of the film is nicely spread around the front and rear sound stages and the many explosions and pounding foley fx  are also spread across both stages.  However, this spread seemed to lack the discreet directionality and the same audio sounded to me as if it were coming from both sides of the rear stage.  This is not to say that there isn't any discreet use of the surrounds, there certainly is, but for the action and movement in the video, directionality often seemed lacking.  Your LFE channel gets a great workout and there really was some very deep bottom end in many parts of the film.  Dialogue is clearly transparent and easy to understand as well as being properly balanced with the score and foley fx.EXTRAS....I love it when there are deleted scenes or outtakes but this Blu Ray didn't have any.  It did come with a  Standard Def version of the film to download into your computer for watching on an iPad and that is always a cool thing, but I don't think I really would want this film on my iPad.  Never the less, it is certainly better than having to rely upon the crappy Ultraviolet which gives you serial numbers that expire after a time.  Other extras include BD Live....does anyone actually use this?  A doc called 'Inside the mind of Sherlock Holmes, Storyboards and a Stills library.  There is a rather unique extra in that you can watch the film with Robert Downy Jr. occasionally interrupting to point out how a scene was made or providing other juicy tidbits regarding the film.Overall, the transfer of both video and audio are as good as they will ever produce this film.

I imagine many readers of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories had this same reaction, and I realize why. The trailers for the film actually do it a disservice by showing all the action and special effects and none of the intellectualism that the writers actually keep somewhat sacred from the source material. Its true that these loyalties are somewhat hidden beneath effects, but nevertheless, I not only liked Ritchie's reimagining of the sly sleuth, but I applauded several times throughout the film.Like all of Ritchie's films, the plot is somewhat convoluted. Three people are credited under screenplay, which may be an indicator that this was a complex screen story to begin with. True enough, the small details of the film are vital, and the manic way that Ritchie directs serves this purpose strangely well, stripping away many pacing issues and much of the banality that could have come attached to this sort of project. As the movie begins, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) manage to bring to justice some kind of black magic-cult leader named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is hanged for several mysterious murders around London. He then rises from the grave, and must be stopped before he fulfills his threatening plot against all of England. Meanwhile, Watson is in the process of retiring from his partnership with Holmes due to his erratic behavior and repellent lifestyle.Of course, they must join together one last time to take down the nemesis Blackwood. In the process of doing so, they encounter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), a criminal and former lover of Holmes' who ran off leaving him heartbroken. Robert Downey Jr. has excellent chemistry with both McAdams and Law, which is crucial in a film with such a confusing plot as this. The characters are very fun to listen to, particularly the bickering between Holmes and Watson, driven by brilliant actors. Downey Jr. is superb as usual here, bringing charm and whimsy while also maintaining Holmes' boozy, fist aiming, somewhat depressed nature.The production design is excellent here, particularly in the final showdown atop an unfinished tower bridge. To see the period placed in this context is truly fascinating. There are some wonderful Ritchie trademarks as well, and he uses all of his best hallmark shots, such as a slow-motion sequence involving a vast amount of explosives. All of these special effects, rather than burying the film's more grounded aspects, simply compliment the subtle and terrific performances, and the complicated but enduring story.Hans Zimmer's excellent score is also noteworthy, as its banjos, accordions, harpsichords, tack pianos, drums and string sections stomp forth and chug along forcefully and confidently, denoting Holmes' certainly that this is just another case that is, as Basil Rathbone's portrayal once said, \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" And, it turns out, my mom enjoyed the film.", "qas": [{"question": "Who says chemistry is not good?", "id": "5c82638e4e9e46581f58823b5d3de0ff", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B001PPLIEG", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Although Quantum of Solace starts where Casino Royale left off, this Bond film does not hold its own with the earlier movie.

Scott Fitzgerald, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a beautiful movie that is both personal in focus, but epic in scope. Set mostly in New Orleans, the film follows the life of a baby boy whose mother dies during his birth on Armistice Day, the end of WWI, November 11, 1918. The baby is so deformed that his father considers killing the child by dropping him in the river, but is stopped by a policeman. Startled the father runs through some streets and down and alley and leaves the baby on the steps of the first reasonable house he comes to. It turns out that the &#34;house&#34; is actually a retirement home for the elderly and the baby is found by the chief caretaker of the place, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Queenie is unable to have children of her own and decides to adopt the child because even if it does look like a devil, it is one of God's children, too. She names the baby Benjamin and in time he begins to grow. As time goes on it appears that instead of growing older Benjamin is growing younger. Such a curious case that Benjamin Button.THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON features some extraordinary acting. Brad Pitt gained most of the attention for his performance as Benjamin, but Pitt's performance is really overrated. I'm not saying he doesn't do a good job, but Pitt actually doesn't show up as Benjamin until about a third of the way through the movie. The reason Benjamin Button is so memorable as a character isn't because of Pitt's acting ability, but because of the makeup and special effects. The real star performers in the film are Cate Blanchett as Daisy and Taraji P. Henson as Queenie. Blanchett is one of the best actresses of the age and Henson proves that she is a rising star.The visual effects, set design, costumes, cinematography, and editing are all notable. In addition, the film has a wonderful score that augments the story that is told. This is the rare movie where all the elements of the movie come together seamlessly as they help create the realistic and authentic world from the past in this fictional tale.Like most great works of art, there are a several meanings you can take away from THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON. There are some who feel the movie is about death and how one goes about facing death. There is an underlying tone of sadness that pervades the picture. However, this sadness is underlying and isn't always prominent. I believe that instead of death and dying, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is, instead, about living. It is true that many characters in the movie die or are in various stages of death throughout the movie. But as Benjamin tells the audience from his own journal, death is just a part of life. All of us have to die, but it is up to us to choose whether to live or just exist and if we chose to live it is also our choice of how we will live. Death, disease, war, accidents, and lost love are all a part of life, but despite the sadness and sorrow life truly is beautiful and the world is full of wonder if we only choose to see it.It should be noted that there are two versions of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON available on DVD. If you are looking for just the movie with no frills, you'll want to purchase the single disc version. However, if you're a bit of a cinemaphile or are a huge fan of the film, you'll probably want to check out the special two-disc version that has a ton of special features, including interviews, featurettes, and special coverage from the film's premiere.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the adventures?", "id": "f969d3f18778776a4c9a7dc59993c2bb", "answers": [{"text": "but epic in scope", "answer_start": 177}]}]}]}, {"title": "B001UV4XEM", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I cried laughing so hard!

The original had that unrelenting graphically violent nature that is rooted around the premise of the lost of innocence, that left its mark 37 or so years ago. Wes Craven was still trying to find his style during the time, and now, he has been trying to revamp his past brainchild such as \"The Hills Have Eyes\" and even has a remake of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" in the works. This remake, while not as exploitive and stomach-turning as the original, is a decent entry in the books of horror.Reeling from the death of their son, Ben, the Collingwoods made up of John (Tony Goldwyn), Emma (Monica Potter), and swimmer daughter Mari (Sara Paxton) decide to go up to their lake house for a little renewal and \"family bonding\". 17-year old daughter Mari, however, has her different idea of fun as she hooks up with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac) that ends up with the two meeting up with a young man named Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) in a small motel. It turns out Justin is the son of a recently escaped convict named Krug (Garret Dillahunt), who along with his wicked girlfriend Sadie (Riki Lindhome), and Francis (Aaron Paul) plan to get out of dodge as soon as possible. Things turn for the worst as Mari and Paige is taken hostage and something truly horrific happens. Later on, Krug and his crew find themselves stranded and they seek refuge in the last house on the left...the very house owned by Mari's parents.Directed by Dennis Iliadis, this re-imagining captures the main premise of the 70's original with some small and some major differences in the screenplay. While the original was utterly violent and exploitive; it was a fine product of the times unleashed to an unprepared audience much like \"I Spit on Your Grave\" which gave it an image/title of \"exploitation classic\", this new remake does try to give certain more fleshed out aspects; such as morality and vengeance, as well as a cautionary tale for teenagers. I find bloody vengeance films a lot of fun to watch, and \"The Last House on the Left\" is all about set ups, as we see destiny plays its hand in order to mess with both our good guys and bad guys.While the original was quick and painful, this remake decides to take its time. The film tries to transcend the usual horror clich&eacute;s, overload of special effects and torture sequences in favor of subtle characterization and careful composition in its storytelling. The raw intensity of the original is lost, and what we see in its place is some subtle tricks in its photography that meanders and dwells on some emotion as we become privy to Mari's ordeal. Director Iliadis tries to lean towards artistry in place of raw brutality--don't get me wrong, the film is pretty brutal, it just follows a different approach. This remake is also less sadistic than the original, but it does definitely generate more sympathy through characterization rather than through its horrific scenes with grand displays of anger and rage. The brutality represented in the original was pure unrelenting violence that displays humanity's sadistic side; it may prove a bit surreal that may distance some viewers from its emotions. The rape scene in the film is as disturbing and savage as in the original with no touches of crude humor. (No inept cops)What is also interesting is the fact that Krug and his crew are brutal but they are brutal when provoked; it feels like they were just doing the brutal deeds out of necessity of the situation. When Mari and Paige tried to escape, their reaction is violent, and without regret. I'm still certain that the two would still be killed after all is said and done; but the script does try to bring some questions as to what would have happened if they just cooperated? However, the direction and screenplay gives no room to feel some sympathy towards Krug and his crew; they are vile, evil and despicable. They really deserved what is coming for them, which allows for the viewer to root for John and Emma all the way. The only one worthy of sympathy would be our mislead character Justin, and not entirely by much. The antagonists this time around are no mere caricatures and they feel a little more real. Krug is presented as a lethal, calculating bad guy who may have just left the Collingwoods after a night's rest, despite the temptations of their baser killer instincts but then again, you`d never know since Francis is somewhat taken by pretty Emma.Purists are bound to be a little upset as even the trailers have shown Mari surviving the rape and while I do somewhat agree with their complaints, Mari's death proved to be the major catalyst for the parents' lust for brutal revenge, this time around the script tries to incorporate a different reason for Emma and John to take the offensive. They have to fight for their barely alive daughter's survival, so they have the added motivation to lay waste upon Krug and his crew of despicable characters. Clues as to how they discover that they were the offenders that attacked their daughter are also handled well. I also enjoyed the scenes when the killing becomes easier for Emma and John after their first kill--all they became concerned about is getting their daughter to safety and woe unto anyone who would stand on their way.Now this remake isn't perfect. I did not like the last scene in the film's end. I thought it was a little tasteless and pointless left as a cheap device to satisfy lovers of blood and gore. That microwave bit just didn't match the tone of the rest of the film. Also, some scenes may leave some viewers scratching their heads, that some scenes felt too convenient. (I found it a bit hard to believe that Krug's crew didn't leave a `sentry') This unrated edition of \"Last House on the Left\" is 4 minutes longer. I read that the rape scene is longer, no so much as more violent but the camera lingers more to generate the effects of Mari`s attack, which proved more unnerving than the theatrical release. There are some extended scenes of shattered necks and stabbing to satisfy fans.More methodical with characterization and a bit more `artsy', this remake stands as one of the best horror remakes of an American film. Rampaging parents in the quest for revenge who become cold-hearted killers is pure fun, and it sure helps when the victims are ugly, unsympathetic bad guys. Iliadis took the film's main premise and made it his own. No, it isn't better than the original, but it's almost like Rocky Road and Chocolate Brownie ice cream--both chocolate, but different flavor. It is a different film that can stand on its own.Recommended!

Never is there a point where Wikus Van Der Merwe and someone else bring the movie to a grinding halt with expository narrative like \"You know, 20 years ago when this first started...\"The trailers gave us what appeared to be a faux-documentary style, involving a modern-day Apartheid... with aliens. That alone would get my butt in a theater seat.Holy hell. In a time period where unique and genuinely great and entertaining movies are a scarcity, this one is a welcome blessing. I hate to do this, but I feel forced to; \"Avatar\", nearly $300 million dollars to make has some of the best and most realistic CGI ever. And it has a story a 4th grader would find lame and stupid. It's story is not unique, not good, not interesting, full of stale cliche's, total lack of surprises, and a tiresome Human-bashing with a glorification of Na'vi culture that is a near perfect mirror for Native American societies before we extinguished them as the evil creatures we were.This movie, meanwhile, is wholly unique, as much as it can be in a day and age where the audience has seen pretty much everything.The setup is right there: Aliens come to Earth as refugees, and rather than go to the stereotypical places of New York or London or Los Angeles, they end up in... Johannesburg, South Africa. After the initial awe of first contact fades, these aliens are now universally hated among the entire local populace.The story is right in front of it: Wikus Van Der Merwe, set up as a doofy, bright-eyed, largely average and sheepish worker for MNU, the company tasked with caring for these aliens (who are revealed to not be very bright, and thought to be proverbial \"worker ants\" of a hive-mind society, or else the slaves/lower classes). The movie begins with a documentary which right away foreshadows exactly what will happen, in a brilliant way that neither draws suspicion nor gives anything away.Wikus seems inexplicably villainized by some of the documentary people for reasons you assume to be due to him being MNU, or being stupid, or making enemies or such. Turns out, he's married the daughter of MNU's boss, and thus cries of NEPOTISM can be raised when he's put in charge of a vast eviction of the alien inhabitants of District 9.The eviction scenes are where the movie's only humor comes, easy and naturally, as Wikus and a co-worker, and a genial, fat MNU soldier go hut to hut trying to get the aliens (called \"Prawns\") to sign them. Rather than show us every single one, they separate some of them with convenient and brilliantly paced and placed bits of exposition, with documentary-style narrative of how the Prawns have existed, how they're treated over the years, how they've committed acts of violence, and how District 9 has attracted gangsters, primarily Nigerian, and how they exploit the Prawn's love of cat food by selling them the stuff in exchange for alien weapons and technology, though this technology is somehow bioengineered to work only for the Prawns.By the time the end of the eviction scenes comes, you're filled in with huge amounts of information, most from these asides, some from Wikus explaining things to his co-worker buddy. The chemistry Sharlto has with the two of them is shockingly good, considering he's never acted before, save for a few seconds in Neil Blomkamp's short film \"Alive in Joburg\", which District 9 is actually based upon. His natural charm and humor is a welcome relief from even atrocities such as a Prawn ripping off a soldier's arm, then being shot to death, or a hut full of Prawn eggs being exterminated with a flamethrower, while Wikus jokes that their deaths sound like popcorn popping.From there, the movie plot focuses on the next main character, a Prawn given the name \"Christopher Johnson\", who has a son. It's in CJ's hut that Wikus is exposed to the alien substance that causes him to slowly change into them. This isn't a spoiler, since the trailers for the DVD gave this away.The rest of the movie becomes part action film, part survival, as Wikus is taken in by MNU, subjected to experiments (including weapons testing, as it's found that the alien arm he's grown is capable of using the alien weapons), and the decision is made to vivisect him to study his body and DNA before the transformation makes him fully Prawn.Everything in this film is wonderfully acted, and meticulously written. Nothing is a red herring---not the documentary segments showing some of the Nigerians believing eating alien parts will cure diseases like STDs and Alzheimer's, nor the Prawn selling a mech-walker machine for cat food, nor the seemingly unimportant bit of documentary footage showing a \"piece\" of the spaceship falling out of it 20 years ago when it first arrived. All of those aspects play a vital part in forwarding the plot.Probably one of the best things about the film is that it doesn't give us a trite, stale, and boring bit of character \"development\" or sudden shocking change or try to make Wikus perfect for the audience's sensibilities (which is exactly what \"Avatar\" does).  Wikus is just as racist towards the aliens as the average person. He regularly calls them Prawns, calls them \"Fookin' creatures\" when accusations are made that he had sex with one of them, he is mean and nasty to some of the Prawns that get unruly or uppity during the eviction, and threatens to take away CJ's son when he throws a lollipop at Wikus's head.Even when Christopher is trying to help him, Wikus remains racist. It isn't until the end that he comes to realize that Christopher is his friend. Even then, we aren't given any \"big revelation\" moment to show that he's changed. Well... we are, but not in that way! Puns ahoy~!It's violent, gory, has \"foul\" language, and it will make you cry. It is also one of the best movies of the year, potentially of the decade.And it bears mentioning... Avatar put on a visual spectacle for $300 million that turned out to be a colorful Candyland version of \"Dances With Wolves\" without any of the compelling drama.District 9 more than exceeds it at literally 1/10th the budget. And while there wasn't as much CG, it bears mentioning that the Prawns are ALL CG, and they look just as realistic as any creature in Avatar---perhaps even more so.DVD/Blu Ray Bonuses:There's more than a dozen deleted scenes. A bunch of them are full-fleshed out scenes from the documentary bits, such as a full version of the aside showing a Nigerian explaining how a piece of alien flesh cures STDs.The best ones are scenes of the eviction, without any CG, showing Jason Cope, who plays Christopher Johnson, standing in for all the Prawns. For the ease of dialogue, he speaks in English, but his intonation and behavior is pure Prawn. And it's just hilarious, seeing him there, physically acting like a Prawn, and saying things that the Prawns say in English. The best one to me was when they caught him stealing televisions.There's much documentaries covering the making of the film and its various aspects, and director commentary which is of great quality of information on the filmmaking and background of it, including background of Johannesburg.Picture quality on the Blu Ray is perfect, as expected.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the plot of this movie?", "id": "c2ba6ae03c5aa22d0f13cd95493a3a76", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B002VKE0XA", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This film is the definition of a \"slow build\" suspense film.

The RDA corporation exploits a precious substance called Unobtanium which has unique abilities to fold space as he meets with new friends like Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Trudy (Michelle Rodriguez) and Norm (Joel David Moore) as they go through a special kind of program called an \"Avatar Program\" where they have Avatar bodies that mixes alien and human DNA as they are psychically linked from their minds into their bodies to infiltrate a Native alien tribe called The Na'Vi. While Rich owner Selfridge Parker (Giovanni Ribisi) and his goon known as Colonel Quatrich (Stephan Lang) have month long plans to find the location of where there is more Unobtanium, Jake gets left behind as he falls in love with a beautiful native girl named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and tries to learn about the cultures of the Na'Vi for studying for soon he becomes one of the people to become their messiah to fight against the enemy.A brilliant and one-of-a-kind Science Fiction action adventure fantasy western from the genius of writer-producer-director James Cameron who had this idea since 1985. He wrote an 80 page screenplay and treatment in 1993 as he would make it for a 1999 release after Titanic but according to Cameron he put it in a drawer as he had to wait until the technology gets more advanced to fulfil his vision as he made documentaries while he waited and produced/created the short lived excellent show \"Dark Angel\". Then after he was blown away by the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong remake from 2005 he was convinced that it's the right time as in 2006 he pulled the screenplay out of the drawer and dusted it off as he wrote an original unique language called \"Na'Vi\" language where it's a mix of Polyesian/South-American Indian language as casting began then filming started in December of 2006 until it wrapped in early 2009. WETA who made the amazing effects for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Pirates of the Caribbean and King Kong made their biggest effects triumph yet on perfecting the art of motion-capture using briliant photorealistic techniques on the Na'Vi people who resemble human-cat people with blue skin. It's nice to see how they did it right on the facial capture including the eyes not being dead but truly alive for Cameron knew he wanted the face to capture the emotions and expressions of the characters, WETA truly nailed it like they did with Gollum and King Kong.The acting is quite good with Zoe being the best performer in the entire film especially Lang as the nifty Gung Ho Quatrich, while the story maybe familar sounding as many of you heard of this being compared to \"Dances with Wolves\" while it maybe similar when this film actually owes itself to the 1950 James Stewart Western classic \"Broken Arrow\" which was THE film that set the big standard for white men being part of another race movie which lead to similar movies over the years such as The Last Samurai, Man Named Horse to even both the book/film of Dances with Wolves as it was their inspiration. I gotta say it's nice to know Cameron is a huge fan of Broken Arrow since he was a kid and he stated he was inspired by Broken Arrow, Frank Herbert's Dune novels, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Heavy Metal Magazine/1981 animated movie, John Carter of Mars, Star Wars Trilogy and even Issac Ashimov's Foundations Trilogy novels since he is a fan of those things. It's an entertaining and visually stunning film that also pays homage to the works of Hayao Miyazaki since Cameron is a fan of Ghibli productions with references to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Princess Mononoke, Castle in The Sky, Pom Poko and My Neighbor Totoro. This movie became the event movie of 2009 as it became a huge success at the box-office as it has turned into the highest grossing movie of all time even with critical acclaim and academy awards, i gotta say i saw this movie 12 times in theaters in 3D and was an experience that needed to be seen. The world of Pandora is very visual and creative as are the creatures with the Na'Vi language, James Cameron did his research while working on the film even when he wrote the treatment in 1993. I gotta applause to one of my favorite directors of all time doing another fantastic film of his catalog of doing this project after all these years and made a new milestone in special effects and one of of those must see movies everyone must see in their life.This Blu-Ray/DVD Combo is bareboned with xero extras at all but has brilliant flawless picture and sound quality as you folks should go for the three disc Collector's edition which had three brilliant versions and tons of extras.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the plot?", "id": "493cc15c8e4b3f088485c0311fcdf7ab", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "WOW!  I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I wish that I had seen it in the theater on the big screen.  This movie was very different and certainly right up my alley with the \"energy\" component.  It has awesome scenery, gadgets, and creatures.  It's about metaphysical energy, the spirits of animals, and our connectedness to nature and each other.  It's also about the terrible things men do for greed.There are a group of approximately 12 foot blue people who live on planet Pandora.  They live in peace with nature and the land, and live in appreciation and respect for all life forms (shamanistic principles).  They are very much in sync with the energy vibrations of each other and spiritual beings. There is a mineral that the earth wants that Pandora has called unobtanium and this grey rock is worth $20 mil a kilo.  Earth has brought a bunch of mercenary soldiers to Pandora determined to get unobtainium any way they can.The Avatar program is earth's attempt to bond with the blue people and learn as much about them as possible, to use the knowledge against them. An Avatar body is part human DNA and part blue people.  Each program participant has their own avatar linked to their DNA, so they can interact together as one.  To activate the Avatar body, you lock down into an electronic bed and meditate out.  Then the Avatar body awakens, hence the name \"Dreamwalker\" by the locals.Jake Sully is a young wheel-chair bound marine who received spinal injuries while fighting for his country.  His brother, Tom, was a scientist who signed up for the Avatar program.  When Tom died, the contract was offered to Jake because Jake has the same DNA (that was already linked to the Avatar body).Grace is Sigourney Weaver, the scientist running the scientific part of the program. Colonel Miles Quaritch is running the military section and he is a tough dude. He asks Sully to get inside the blue people's heads and get him what info he needs to be able to control or conquer them and he will get Sully his legs back when Sully rotates home. (The operation is too expensive for Jake to handle alone.)  The blue peopl's village is right on the richest deposit of unobtanium.  Jake has 3 months before the bulldozers get there to befriend the blue people and convince them to move out of the way.So, like a good little soldier, Jake heads to the dangerous Pandora forest with Grace and others.  Running from a wild beast and barely escaping, Jake is lost in the jungle overnight where he is helped by Neytiri (father is clan leader/chief; mother is a spiritual leader/shaman).  Eywa is their name for God.  After a spiritual sign, Neytiri introduces Jake to her parents and they assign Neytiri to teach Jake to be one of them.  It's really cool to watch Jake learn the spiritual oneness that these people offer.  As Jake learns from and appreciates the magnificent beauty in their culture, he begins to realize the \"war\" with the blue people is all about greed.There is so much in this movie to appreciate.  The concepts of tying into the energy of all living things, living in peace and gratitude, sharing energy, that we are all connected and all energy beings, that there is a supreme spiritual being and spiritual helpers, the concept of taming your dragon--so much here that I already believe.  My sincerest appreciation to the writer/director James Cameron for putting this movie out for the world to see.Even if it is all just sci-fi fantasy to you, the storyline is great!  The colors are brilliant, the creativity is fantastic, the computer graphic imaging and animation is remarkable.  I think this movie has something for everybody.  I loved it.  It's a movie that leaves you thinking about it. I know I will watch this movie many times.2009/2010--162 minutesNote--My son said he saw a \"making of\" special on tv.  They hired a professor to make up some words to use as the blue people's language.  The professor developed a whole new language just for this movie!  Is that cool or what!  You will see the language woven into the movie with English subtitles.Note#2--I see where another reviewer said a lot of footage was cut out.  Not having watched it in the theater, I was not aware anything was missing. Although I am anxious to see what was cut, I loved this movie as shown.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the plot?", "id": "71a697d139fe26f84350bedb7040f6fa", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Let me start off by saying that I am one of the people that saw Avatar multiple times in theaters and loved it.  The CGI , as well as the 3D technology infused, were by far the best I have ever seen.  James Cameron and all of the people who participated in the making of this movie did a tremendous job.  Weta workshop is taking its place at the top of the mountain, as far as visual effects companies go.  Watching this movie was like being transported to a different universe.  I was completely immersed throughout the almost three hours I was in the theater.As for the story and acting for the film, I am probably in the minority on most of these reviews.  The story for me, while predictable and reminiscent of other movies I'd seen previously (What movie isn't nowadays?), was extremely enjoyable.  Watching this made me feel young again.  It made me forget about all the worries that an adult life brings, and just enjoy myself in the moment.  Many people argue that the acting in this movie was subpar.  These people say that the portrayals of the characters were downright cartoonish.  I would argue strongly against that.  For the type of movie that this is, the good versus evil portrayals given by the actors works in the movie's  favor.  Sam Worthington especially does well.  If you haven't seen him in Terminator: Salvation, do so.  He made the movie worth watching.Now, to get to the actual product at hand.  I ordered the Blu Ray / DVD combo pack from Amazon.  From the moment the menu came onto my screen, I knew this was going to be something special.  When I pressed play, there was no turning back.  Over the next three hours, my senses were completely assaulted and my mind was dumbstruck.  Simply put, James Cameron's Avatar on the Blu Ray format is the best picture and audio we have seen or heard to date.  I have a feeling it will be years before anything better is brought to the table.  Watching the visuals was more stimulating than looking at a real life forest.  Every detail could be seen from far and away.  The walls of my house shook, and I just hope the neighbors did hear.  I would tell them to buy the movie themselves and experience it.With this release comes certain issues.  While I don't have any of them myself, I will still talk about them as it would be uninformative of me to not.  This release of Avatar is not in 3D.  Many people complain about this, and a large percentage of those people do not even have the right equipment to properly experience 3D yet.  The technology for home theater 3D is very new and very pricey.  Next year, after all the quirks have been worked out, is when we will likely see Avatar in a home release 3D format.  Another gripe is the complete lack of special features.  This again has a good reason.  In the Special Edition coming later this year, there will be scenes incorporated into the movie not even visually completed yet.  Documentaries in high definition have to be put together.  A commentary track needs to be recorded.  No one is being forced to buy this \"stripped\" edition, however. I am one of the people who will knowingly double or triple dip on this.  The reason for that is because I love it so much.Now to the biggest complaint.  During the initial release, many people were complaining that Avatar would not play in their Blu Ray players.  The reason for that seems to be some new copy protection put on the disc.  While I was not one of the people with this problem, I can certainly sympathize with those who did.  A new firmware update is all it will take to fix the issue.  My PS3, which serves as my Blu Ray player, had a firmware update ready for me before I watched the movie.So if you are one of the millions who loved Avatar when you saw it in theaters, or one of the people who didn't get around to seeing it, now is your time.  Pick this movie up right away without hesitation.  Keep an open mind, and let yourself become immersed.

Rumors placing Avatar's budget at somewhere between 250 and 300 million dollars, are not in the least bit unfortunate; as the film has already more than doubled that amount in profits, and is still continuing to roll in the dough for 20th Century Fox.James Cameron promised the world he would deliver us something that we had never seen before and needless to say, he delivered. He filmed a rough cut of the entire movie once, three years ago with the entire cast in special-ally designed suites that would visually capture their every movement, to later be loaded into computers. Then, he waited; for technology to advance so that he could apply the CGI to his actors properly, and finish the film.I have heard a lot of what I like to call jealous and or insecure people, ripping on Cameron for being a poor writer. I have read a lot of screenplays and I recently read his script for his 1986 film, Aliens. I'm here to tell you, it was the best original screenplay I have ever read. James Cameron is a true artist both visually and on the page.He may not create some of the most dialogue-driven characters and his films do tend to have the traditional three act structure with a boy meets girl concept to them; but clearly he's doing a good job, or his films would not be as successful as they are. Much like Michael Bay, Cameron doesn't need avid fans like me to defend him - the ticket-sales speak more than loudly enough on his behalf; so I'll shut up about that now, and get on with the review.Sam Worthington stars as a wheel-chair-bound Marine, by the name of Jake Sully. The year is 2154 and wars still wage on. When a group of Military officials decide to raid a foreign planet called Pandora, in search of valuable minerals; they need Jake's help.Prior to being killed, the Military had a special avatar designed for Jake's twin brother to operate. They planned on using this avatar to blend in with the natives of Pandora, in an effort to obtain valuable information regarding the whereabouts of the precious mineral. Having the exact genetic build as his twin, Jake sees how valuable he is. If he agrees to help, he will be given an expensive operation that will restore his legs to working order. He agrees.Pandora is a truly beautiful place. In a way it resembles Earth a great deal. It has rich green forests and breath-taking waterfalls. It also has islands, but rather than poke up from the ocean, they simply float in mid-air. The downside is that its air source is not adaptable for human lungs.The inhabitants of Pandora are a race of large blue people with tails, pointy cat-like ears and yellow eyes, standing at maybe 10 or 12 feet in height. Jake's avatar, is designed to look like one of these natives of Pandora, called the Na'vi.He is heavily sedated in a special tube-like chamber and once unconscious, is able to mobilize his avatar with his brain. He can taste, touch, feel, hear, see and even walk or run with his new body. Worthington is marvelous at convincing us that it has been God knows how long, since he had the use of his legs.Once on Pandora, Jake meets a beautiful native named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). She saves his life from a savage beast of her forest, and takes him to meet her people. He becomes attached to the Na'vi and especially Neytiri.When the Military reveal their plans to annihilate the Na'vi, if they don't disperse from the area where the sacred mineral is believed to be; Jake must defend them. The Military is headed up by one of the best villains ever: Colonel Miles Quaritch. He was played superbly by Stephen Lang.If you get a chance to see the film in 3-D, I highly recommend it. It's without a doubt the best 3-D film I have ever seen. It's not done to have cheap thrills pop out your face simply for the purpose of making you jump in your seat. It's designed to make you feel like you are there with the characters and that's exactly what it does.One of the things I found most interesting about the film, was the numerous uses of avatars. Jake's character obviously uses his avatar to blend in with the Na'vi. The Military use avatar-like robots similar to those used in Aliens and Iron Man, to navigate around; and the Na'vi use animals and creatures in the forest as avatars, by linking their tentacle-like membranes into the ears of these beasts.It's more than obvious that the film has underlying themes regarding the early Americans and the Native Americans. You can arguably find similarities in today's political issues and conflicts as well. What's great however is that they aren't forced down our throats, and if wanted they could easily be overlooked entirely, for the purpose of just enjoying the film.I've heard countless opinions of people who think James Cameron is a racist against whites because he makes them look bad by taking over the Na'vi; I have head others say he's racist because the Na'vi are played by either black or Native American actors and he purposely had them be dark-skinned characters etc, etc. Having seen the film twice and having heard James Cameron defend it in countless interviews; I can honestly say that I don't think he is coming from a racial, anti-American or in any other possible way, negative place with Avatar. It's simply a film about people in general and the main thing to take from is as simple as the oldest rule in the book: do unto others as you would have done unto you.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the thing?", "id": "e2193ce5ca09af935a9cbc5030854535", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Avatar is an excellent example of what's wrong with movies today.

If you've ever seen a movie of any kind, you'll know how this movie will start, how it will progress, and how it will end.  There's not one plot event, let alone twist, that will engage you.  There's not one line of dialogue that's interesting, let alone memorable.  There's not one character, human or alien, that's emotionally engaging.  It's three hours of eye candy puffing up a ten-minute story.]Anyway, in case you've been held hostage by pirates for the last year*, Avatar is about the exploitation of an Eden-like planet named Pandora.  An evil corporation (what other kind is there in movies?) wants to push the indigenous population out of the way to get their land; they don't want to go; the evil corporation's evil security guy wants a stack of charred bodies, pronto (isn't he *evil*?); a nice guy is sent to negotiate...and you can figure out the rest.Why this took nearly three hours to tell is beyond me; every sequence drags on too long, because every sequence is a step towards a foregone conclusion.

It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine.  And sure enough, \"Avatar\" has become the latter.  The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece.  Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, \"Avatar\" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.VIDEO:\"Avatar\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video.  Detail and colors are just amazing.  The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection.  You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters.  How do they do that?  There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.And it just doesn't stop there.  There is detail everywhere.  From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs.  I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but \"Avatar\" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray.  Incredible!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Avatar\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And you think that \"Avatar\" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for \"Avatar\" is equally fantastic!Immersive.  This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged.  Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of \"Avatar\" makes those scenes come alive.  The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.Again... Incredible!As for subtitles, \"Avatar\" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Avatar\" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.EXTRAS:\"Avatar\" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.JUDGMENT CALL:When \"Avatar\" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see a sci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch.  Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" but when I saw the trailer for \"Avatar\", I was sensing CG eye candy ala \"Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen\".With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that \"Avatar\" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight.  It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema.  But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with \"Titanic\", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.Of course, \"Avatar\" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film.  What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer.  Without it becoming an all eye candy film.Well, let's just say that after I watched \"Avatar\", I was blown away.  Yes, \"Avatar\" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it.  Films such as the \"Star Wars\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds.  That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about \"Avatar\".Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, \"Avatar\" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi.  Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet.  Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.The detail of this film is amazing.  On Blu-ray, it's fantastic!  The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect.  The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced.  I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case.  Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well.  And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in \"Avatar\" is a nostalgic blessing.  She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the \"Alien\" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing.  What the \"Star Wars\" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, \"Avatar\" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fi films today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read \"Salon\" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.  Zacherek writes, \"The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's \"Avatar\" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is  a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.\"I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement.  The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world.  Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with \"Titanic\", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film.  But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing.  The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal.  And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, \"Avatar\" was deserving in winning \"Best Achievement in Art Direction\", \"Best Achievement in Cinematography\" and \"Best Achievement in Visual Effects\".She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action.  You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi.  It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences.  And the \"godawful dialogue\", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for \"Avatar\", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that \"Village Voice\" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well.  Hoberman writes, \"For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.\"I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films.  Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing \"Metropolis\" and \"Avatar\" is comparing apples to oranges.  Where both films feature a revolt, \"Metropolis\" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors.  In \"Avatar\", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight.  And what kind of film would \"Avatar\" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?The second half needed that battle and like \"Metropolis\", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right!  That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.So, I came away enjoying \"Avatar\" much more than I expected.  The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality.  Special features are none but similar to \"Sin City\" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to \"Avatar\".  I am sure like the video releases of \"Titanic\" and \"Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of \"Avatar\".  This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.I know many people may hold off until the better version of \"Avatar\" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy \"Avatar\" now, you can.  James Cameron's \"Avatar\" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc.  Although, this is not the ultimate release of \"Avatar\" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, \"Avatar\" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.Highly recommended!", "qas": [{"question": "What the quality of color?", "id": "ea63a76fd4f3ad9a8acfc1d3e27bd12b", "answers": [{"text": "the", "answer_start": 1486}]}, {"question": "What is the color of the paint?", "id": "0a55ff5e91f4f897a892e87fdc84a687", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).  These actors fill in the various gaps quite nicely.  No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.

It's terrible. One-dimensional characters, a cliched and hackneyed plot, and some of the worst dialog since Twilight was forced on the eager masses. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this over-hyped piece of garbage. This film is basically a protoype representing what is possible with the new computer-generated technology, but the movie itself is slapped together and has little or no redeeming quality.There are so many things in the movie that just don't make sense. With the exception of Sigourney Weaver, who is quite good in the movie, there are absolutely no notable performances. The direction movies are taking, where an entire film can be shot inside a computer, or against blue screens...some of the magic is lost. Nothing feels real. I guess we are supposed to sympathize with the protagonist, but there is no depth to him at all. In fact there is no depth to any of the characters. Almost every single one of them is a simple cliche. Which isn't a problem, and in fact some very good movies are made without any sort of originality. But when you want an audience to really connect to the movie you're making, you have to give them something to grab on to.I am obviously in the minority, but I watched it with my dad and brother, and none of us could get past how awful the dialog is. The story isn't original, but it isn't necessarily bad. It's really the poor casting choices and the poor script that bring this movie down. After the movie ended, I pictured Sam Worthington reading through the script, turning to James Cameron, laughing and saying \"No really where's the real script?\" And apparently even with the development of intergalactic space space travel, the military is still stuck in the 18th century. How exactly would a racist redneck be put in command of an entire military base? Why would you want someone like that in place when you know they just want to go out and kill everything that moves? See, they could have done that, but then the movie should have been about the Na'Vi mounting a resistance. I don't understand why they bothered trying to have peaceful negotiations at all. With a military leader like that things are only going to end one way, really.The whole movie really just felt like one plot convenience after another, like no real effort was put into making sure that there were emotionally connecting reasons behind why the people in the story did what they did. I understand that James Cameron has pushed the boundaries in Avatar of what is possible on a technical level, but he should not have directed the movie. He should have been the DP (director of photography) on the movie.

The flying rock mountains, the fluorescent plantlife and animals, the soaring flying scenes are all just fantastic.  And of course, coming from the creator of the first two \"Terminator\" movies, the action scenes are first rate and terrifying.The storyline is a very recognizable one that is often repeated in American cinema.  The story is basically a combination of \"Pocahontas\", \"Dances With Wolves\",  \"Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest\", \"Dune\", \"Tarzan\", and lots of other similar tales of a young man's journey into heroism,  rising from nothing to become a powerful leader/defender of another people, another world.  And along this journey, the young man meets the female who will be his devoted mate for life.  The story has echoes of Joseph Campbell and \"The Power of Myth\",  with the added post-modern, post-Title IX twist of the female saving the life of our hero at the end.The fact that this story resonates so deeply in American culture is simply a reflection of its importance in early American history, as this was not a myth based on white guilt, but a true story and common occurrence.  In the early days of contact between white settlers and Indians, many young white men did in fact choose to run away from their repressive European cultures to the free and open Indian societies,  often taking an Indian woman as a wife.  Sam Houston, a hero of Texas, was but one such example of a young man who ran away to live with the Indians, taking an Indian wife along the way;  Houston did go on to lead not the Indians, but the Texans, to freedom.And as pointed out in the book \"1491\", it was this interaction between white settlers and the Indian tribes that fundamentally shaped the character of early Americans, transforming the rigid and hidebound hierarchies of their European origins into the egalitarian and libertarian ideals of Indian culture.Supposedly, James Cameron took four years to make this movie.  It shows in the facial features of Sam Worthington who was only 31 when he was first cast and looks noticeably younger and more baby-faced in some of the scenes compared to others.I kept thinking back to when the last time was that I had seen such lush and powerfully creative fantasy images - so much of the background scenery from this movie could stand on their own as superb fantasy artwork, suitable for framing.  It has been a really long time - not since the fantastic artwork of Frazetta and others in the 1970's have I seen such beautiful fantasy artwork.  And so in the end, it was not the much-hyped CGI that drew me into this movie, it was the all-encompassing, outstanding fantasy artwork which made the world of Pandora come alive.The movie is certainly one of Cameron's best efforts yet (supplanting \"Aliens\"), and worthy of repeat viewing in the theaters... now if I can just get those darned 3-D glasses to fit...Addendum:Well, I managed to see this movie three times now, all in 3D, the first time in Dolby 3D, the second in IMAX 3D, and the third time in Real 3D.The IMAX 3D was actually the worst experience for me - because of the ancient linear polarization technology, the 3D effect was lost any time I tilted my head, and I would start to see double images onscreen.  As is often cited, the IMAX technology produced the greatest amount of 3D effect, but things tended to blur in the periphery of the image onscreen.  All of this gave me a headache after three hours of watching this movie.  Part of that may have been from the effort of having to keep my head straight and level for that period of time.The Real 3D was probably the best experience for me - the large glasses fit easily in front of my own glasses, and I had no trouble watching the movie and getting a 3D effect.  It was the most comfortable experience, and the bright screen made the images stand out, making it look as good if not better than the IMAX images.The Dolby 3D was only so-so.  The biggest problem was the small glasses.  It is often mentioned that the glasses are more expensive, perhaps that's why the lenses are so much smaller than the other two technologies.  I had trouble fusing the two images together into a 3D effect at times.  The picture was not quite as bright and sharp as the other two, as this technology is projected onto a regular movie screen.  But at least I could let my head loll around during the movie.So if you get the chance, I would recommend going the Real 3D route.

For me, the scenes in the Hallelujah Mountains alone were worth the price of the rental. The background music was wonderful as well!  If only Mr. Cameron would've made the movie as a sort of modern technical `Fantasia'  without any talking! The dialogue was weak. At some points it was laughable. The characters were blatantly one dimensional. The Stephen Lang character was a parody of himself! Sigourney's  character was consistently irritating. Also, it seems to me that a large portion of these Amazon reviews seem to be people falling into queues behind those who espouse Mr. Cameron's world view (or more specific his view of western society and religion), and those who don't. That's the central `vibe' I'm getting in reading these reviews. As far as the movie itself, I thought it was a movie worthy of the money it made at the box office. Visually, like I said earlier, it was amazing and cutting edge as Mr. Cameron's work always is (technically speaking). Avatar is eye candy;  amazing to watch and a joy to my visual artistic sensibilities. However, I completely understand why it didn't win the Best Picture Oscar. (The `Hurt Locker' at least was fair in it's portrayal of soldiers and showed  multi dimensional characters).  Like many reviewers, I didn't find the Avatar story to be too original. But, I guess that itself isn't why I'm giving it three stars.  Lots of stories, screenplays and movies worth seeing aren't original. They are just good stories that never get old. They aren't overly `preachy'. Avatar unfortunately has a  dogmatic  presence that is too in your face. If would be fine if it were just a generic  good/evil thing like `Lord Of The Rings'. But Cameron identifies evil with/as one specific  thing and benevolent good with the other. War loving U.S. Marines bad; peaceful  benevolent natives good; greedy rich bad; innocent poor good, etc. It's his sermon and he's entitled to it; it's obviously a free country. But personally I think he should stick to his strength (cutting edge technology) and preach less. The sermon (at least to me), is tiresome. I heard it with Dances With Wolves and I really get the message. No need to repeat it. This is basically Dances With Wolves with blue faces on a colorful virgin planet. I half expected Mr. Cameron to have the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" playing during the closing credits....Imagine there's no heavenIt's easy if you tryNo hell below usAbove us only sky.......", "qas": [{"question": "How is the plot?", "id": "fbe2fd476730af6be089fafb255ecb32", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "In case you haven't seen the more revealing trailers, Avatar's story falls in the family of films like Pocahontas or Tarzan - the clash of two disparate worlds. A human company has arrived at Pandora to mine for a very valuable rock, but there's a village of natives, the Na'vi, who are sitting on a large deposit of this rock. Sam Worthington's character is part of the Avatar program, in which a human's being can be transferred to a genetically engineered Na'vi version of himself, to try to learn from the Na'vi and find a way to get this village to move. I know that sounds like I just spoiled the whole movie for you, but that all probably happened in the first 20 minutes. It's literally nearly 3 hours long, so a lot happens in it. I'd say 4 major acts, in all.There are some movies that you can look at over the history of film making and know that they are classics for one reason or another. On my short list of classics would be Chinatown, The Godfather, The Matrix, Star Wars: A New Hope, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. You can say what you will about them, but they're definitely classics. If I had an honorable mentions list it'd probably include Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but neither of those series' starting movie was as important as the movies I just listed (which is obviously not an exhaustive list). I think Avatar is a movie we're going to look back on as a big deal in science fiction films and probably in films, in general.I heard all this hype about the movie but didn't buy any of it because the movie didn't look interesting to me. I was as big a skeptic as they come and insulted that James Cameron claimed a CG movie was an innovation, even if it was 3-D. Both those technologies had already existed, so what was the big deal? Well, he was right: I don't think I've ever been so impressed with computer graphics before in my life. He was able to map his actors/actress's faces to their computer-generated forms to display real emotions. It's phenomenal. I felt more for these characters than many movies I've seen with live action movies. As for being in 3-D - it looks amazing in 3-D. It's no longer that stupid gimmick at your local science museum from when you were little where at special moments you'd put on these gigantic classes to see something silly coming at you. It's not a gimmick at all in this movie, in fact - it's a part of how you experience the movie. It makes everything very palpable to the point that I don't know how I'd react to some scenes if I saw them in 2-D. The idea of depth of field you get in some scenes is very valuable for conveying a lot of information to you without having to spend a lot of time on it or just use camera tricks. To not see this movie in 3-D is a disservice to yourself since seeing it in 2-D will be easy once it's out on home video. Back to just the visuals though: the level of detail in this movie is awe-inspiring. You definitely willfully would forget that the world you're seeing isn't real and that these creatures are just computer generated - they're that realistic. Part of what makes you believe is that when you see scenes that didn't need to be computer generated - the scenes between just humans - they don't look computer generated at all. If you see this movie for nothing else other than to enjoy it as a visual feast then it was well worth the price of admission.When it comes to the acting and writing, you start entering somewhat thorny territory. I enjoyed the story more than I thought it would. It was somewhat formulaic but still epic and engaging. It wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be, and I was still happy with the direction it went in. Some of the writing came off to me as a little kludgy and corny. Strangely, I found myself moved even by a couple of the cornier scenes. The acting by most of the leads was strong, especially Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and Zoe Saldana. Giovanni Ribisi never made sense to me though and Stephen Lang's role as the Colonel felt hollow and stereotypical. I think that's more due to the writing than his portrayal though. I did find myself enjoying Michelle Rodriguez as the same character she always plays, but I have a soft spot for her so I was ok with that. The movie was definitely way too long. I don't know what they could've done about that, but it was quite long. To be honest, I enjoyed it enough that I didn't mind sitting through all of it, but I can see other people losing interest during the slower parts. The set up of the film feels like a bunch of scenes I won't want to watch whenever I get it on Blu-ray, but once it gets going it really does fly by. It reminds me a bit of the end of a Metal Gear Solid game where the ending keeps getting prolonged. I know I'm saying a lot of bad stuff here, but the writing was good overall and I thought the language they created was actually kind of cool. All the Na'vi characters were very cool and well-designed.The bottom line is that you have to see this movie. There's no reason to not go out and see this movie in 3-D if you're in a place that has it in 3-D. If you do not you will almost certainly regret it. Whether or not you like sci-fi, this is an important movie to see right now in theaters. Even if you don't love it like I did, you will at least appreciate the significance of the technology at play here. Even the people I knew who didn't love it definitely didn't hate it, so I think it's a fair bet that you won't hate it either. It'll almost certainly come out on Blu-ray in 3-D, possibly the first movie to do so, but unless you're rich I'm guessing that you're not getting a 3-D TV set and this is one of the very few movies where 3-D adds to the experience. If you see it in 3-D and hate it then you can yell at me about it later.

I had great expectations, having seen Aliens, Terminator 1 & 2, The Abyss, Titanic, just to name a few of his blockbuster hits.  Cameron's films always come rolling in, guns blasting, edge of your seat action, heart thrilling scenes and teeth gnashing bad guys.  The exact thing I love.Let me prepare you, this movie is two and a half hours long.  It is not something you take a child under the age of  eight to and expect them to sit still, unless they love video games and the entire idea of getting sucked into their own avatar.I'm into XBOX 360 so, if you don't know what an avatar is, here's the definition compliments of Webster:  the incarnation of a Hindu deity; an incarnation in human form; an embodiment (as of a concept or philosophy)often in a person; a variant phase or version of a continuing basic entity; an electronic image that represents and is manipulated by a computer user (as in a computer game).That's the entire idea behind this movie.  An alternative life from the one that you may have now.I'll give you a heads-up, whatever bad you may hear about the movie, if you love Cameron's work, ignore it.Avatar starts out a little slow.  If you're a fan of NatGeo or The Discovery Channel programs, the start of the film involves the subject of basic  'Living Among the Na'vi'.  The Na'vi are the indigenous people thriving on Planet Pandora and their existence is being threatened by a major corporation that wants a crucial mineral that exists only on their homeland.  There's a purpose for this, if you  have an open mind.My thoughts:  So-Called Civilized man-made it a point to habitat foreign lands and either convert or destroy the locals for their own gain.  As always, the natives were refered to as savages, lacking any idea of the knowledge the civilized race brought them because they were just so backwards and ignorant.Avatar explores the question: Would civilized man's thinking change if it were another planet?Cameron paraplegic hero, Jake Sully, has the opportunity to live among the Na'vi in an alternate reality.  Jake molds, bonds and begins to understand.  He sees this new world and the natives for what they are, far more intelligent than his counterparts believe.  There is a bonding between the Na'vi and mother earth that is deep and profound, calling back to the tales we read from our own heritage.This film is intriguing, beautiful, a dynamic explosion that bursts from the screen.  The jungle, the wildlife,the Na'vi,  the flora and fauna, there's not enough words to describe the beauty of this movie.  It's has captured the most breathtaking and believable artistic sense I have seen in years.The drama and the greed brought on by what the Na'vi have on their land is brought to light with the savagery that must have been experienced by the indigenous people that populated our own world in the time of discovery.  Change or suffer the consequences, with the possibility of mass genocide by the so-called higher intelligence factor.The hero, Jake Sully, has to decide what is more important.  The life he knew or the life that exists only in his dreams.I'll leave you hanging there because I hate it when the review tells the entire story.  All I can say was there was, when I saw this film at the theater, there was a hushed lull that fell over the audience during the entire film, not a child cried, whimpered or whined.  Not a soul bounded up and down the stairs seeking refills or a bathroom break.  There was clapping throughout the audience when the credits rolled and my boys, ages 8 and 14, were among them.Great, great movie to add to your Christmas stocking stuffer list!", "qas": [{"question": "Does the costume design great?", "id": "15f249777eee235c0e7b16260bf32ffa", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron once again made cinematic history with the breathtaking science fiction blockbuster Avatar. In the distant future, a handicapped ex-Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) accepts a job to aid a human colony in their mining venture in the jungle planet of Pandora where its inhabitants known as the Na'vi are strongly against the destruction to their home. Using an alien hybrid called an avatar, he makes contact with the Na'vi and becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. Avatar is an extraordinary and visually groundbreaking film spectacle that ranks as one of the most imaginative Sci-Fi movies in cinema history. Thought the story may be a somewhat clich&eacute;d with obvious stereotypes, the film is nevertheless entertaining and embracing. Cameron and his technical crew have spent many years developing the technology to create this Sci-Fi world and its inhabitants. Avatar represents an impressive leap in special effects and 3D technology. The cast also stars Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi and Sigourney Weaver.Avatar Extended Collection Edition is truly a must-have for Sci-Fi fans and home video enthusiasts. The award-winning blockbuster is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. The 3-disc Blu-ray includes the original theatrical version, the special edition re-release and the 3-hour extended cut.

As far as the acting, again, it was o.k. I enjoyed this movie much more as an experience, a visual and auditory action ride so to speak than as a \"film\" in any way. Many may disagree with my assesment in that regard however and that's ok.So, I Watched Avatar in 3D yesterday for the first time and honestly, I think the studio made a huge mistake having an exclusivity deal with Panasonic because if any 3D movie was ever going to get people to buy into the whole 3D thing, this movie would have been the one. Not that the 3D thing needed all that much help I guess as many people who bought newer HDTVs in the last couple of years were force fed one 3D technology or another (active/passive). In my case, I had no real interest in 3D but last year when I was in the market for a new HDTV, it seemed that all of my potential candidates had the technology built in so I was getting it whether I wanted it or not. For those reading this review and that are interested in knowing, the T.V. used to watch Avatar 3D was my Panasonic TC-P55VT30 (professionaly calibrated in February, 2012 by Kevin Miller) and the disc player used was my OPPO BDP-95. I own a few other 3D blu-rays such as Kung Fu Panda 2, HUGO, Alice in Wonderland, Lion King and a couple of others but Avatar easily beats them all in the 3D department in my opinion. Although initially I wasn't really interested in 3D, my new T.V. had the feature so naturally I picked up a few 3D discs to check it out. The ones I picked up were supposedly some of the best 3D discs out there in regards to picture quality and the use of the 3D tech so my expectations were pretty high. Each of those 3D movies was good in their own right to varying degrees but I was never totally blown away by the 3D in any of them. After watching them all, I was somewhat impressed by how far the tech had come and I did take notice of a few standout 3D scenes in each of them but overall I was left a little underwhelmed. That would lead me to wonder if they were even worth always watching in 3D or if watching the (usually included) standard blu-ray would be just as, if not more satisfying somehow. My issues with them all (the 3D effect that is) to one degree or another was that they don't always look as pin sharp as the standard, non 3D blu-ray and all of them exhibit some minor ghosting in several scenes which makes the image appear a little blurry at times. Some of the ghosting could possibly be attributed to my TV's handling of the 3D or the disc player's output of it to be sure but either way, while they were enjoyable enough in 3D, I just wasn't blown away. Unitl last night that is. Avatar was a near revalation in 3D compared to my other 3D discs. There was some minor ghosting in just a few scenes and not every single scene was razor sharp at all times but overall this movie had so many visually beautiful moments in 3D that it really made a very strong case for the 3D genre. There were many scenes that were in fact very sharp, clear and with standout depth and dimensiality. Avatar 3D has great colors, textures and it finally gave me that wow factor I was hoping for with my other 3D discs. The 3D in this movie really brought me further into the story and even nearly made me forget I was wearing those goofy glasses just to be able to enjoy it. I don't mean to make it seem as though those other 3D movies aren't good when it comes to the 3D effect in each of them, that's not the case. They are good and there are a couple of standout scenes in each of them but I just wasn't truly wowed by either of them. I was more like \"Ok, that was cool, not bad\". but I did enjoy them nonetheless so I would say that compared to Avatar 3D, they're very good but just not truly great. Avatar 3D, so far, is the best 3D disc out there right now in my opinion. I'm really hoping more 3D movies will have this level of 3D \"rightness\" because when it's done this well, it is very enjoyable and you can't imagine NOT watching the 3D version. I give the movie 5 stars for the 3D effect but only 2.5 (maybe 3 at best) stars for the storyline which I added up to the 4 stars I gave it overall.

The story while interesting in places and the theme of fighting for your land is nice it lacks any real depth.  It does not feel as epic as the lord of the rings movies did.  The animation and scenery is nice but nothing i haven't seen in games like Final Fantasy 13!I was kind of expecting a little more.  at least titanic had a bit of depth to it.

I was wrong.  To start off, the special effects were one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life.  Every scene was portrayed with color and vibrancy.  It even made the Hallelujah Mountains (floating mountains) seem legitimate.  Although the actors may not be exactly who you would have expected, they did a phenomenal job.  When you are watching the movie you truly believe that the actors are the character they play.  Each line was spoken with true feeling and emphasis.  One of the most remarkable things about the movie was the language.  The fact that the movie producers can create an entirely made up language and then have each actor memorize it is beyond me.On the surface it may seem that the storyline is pretty fantasized and has nothing to do with your life, but if you dig a little deeper you will realize that it is very relevant.  The movie brings up the idea of corporate greed.  The government wants to go to Pandora and harvest its riches.  When they get there they realize that an entire population is settled on the land, but they do not care.  All they want is the riches and therefore are willing to do anything to get it.  I think that, along with some fighting scenes, is the reason it is truthfully rated pg13.  Despite the great aspects, the fact that they name the ore that they cannot obtain \"unobtainium\" is pretty cheesy.  If you are going to create an entire dialogue for the Navi you can at least come up with a clever name for some ore.My favorite scene was towards the end when Neytiri fought Colonel Miles Quaritch.  This scene was very dramatic because Jake Sully was trapped unconscious and Neytiri had to get to him first otherwise he would die.  The blows went back and forth, Neytiri riding a vicious beast, and Colonel Miles Quaritch fighting inside a robot.  When Neytiri knocked Colonel Miles Quaritch's gun out of his hands he pulled out his knife and killed the beast.  It landed on top of Neytiri trapping her under his corpse.  This scene supports the theme of the movie which is trust.  Neytiri had to decide whether or not to accept Jake as one of the Navi and had to trust him.  The same went for Jake.  He needed to decide whether or not he should trust the marines or the Navi.

Cher takes her under her wing and is pleasantly suprised to see the singing and dancing talent that springs forth. I love how the movie has many musical numbers and dances creatively weaved into it. In some of the scenes Christina basically sings how she is a good girl (while gyrating in some very glamorous and provocative outfits).  I mean this with both respect for Christina and Cher, but if that good girl musical number in the movie is any indicator of how she is in real-life then I would have to say that Christina probably has a wild and fun side to her good girl side as well. Cher successfully plays a self-confident mentor who helps teach her increased wisdom. The movie also includes a wonderful cast of gifted models and dancers. I also think that a good job was done in casting the actor who plays love interest of Christina Aguilera (the very handsome and talented Cam Gigandet).

Being more of a Horror-Movie buff than anything else, I don't really expect much out of other genres - although, to be fair, I don't expect much out of Horror either.  Few movies have the kind of insight; synthesis of talent; and stellar presentation to win me over; and if you compound this general statement of artistic scarcity with a marked lack of even the most petty of scares, I'm usually ready to not watch and say that I did.  Well, this happens to be one of the occasions where I'm glad I was talked into watching.  Despite a silly, somewhat childish approach to the topic (although this was almost necessary, and actually lent the movie its charm), HtTYD does what few movies manage to do: it engaged me on an emotional level.  Indeed, even having watched this movie once before, I still found myself reacting as if I'd never seen it before - an unusual event for any artistic endeavor.Story-wise, from the standpoint of the generally accepted &#34;NO SPOILERS&#34; rule, there's not much to tell: Vikings kill dragons (like they do); boy meets dragon; boy saves everyone because of dragon.  But this simplicity does nothing to detract from the experience, as it's character interaction and dedication to the roles that wins the day on this venture.  Despite humor that ranges from goofy to pre-adolescent, never once did I feel myself becoming disengaged from the spectacle.  No one character is overbearing or underwhelming; and all of the actors manage to pull their roles together in a way that does nothing but show this gem for what it really is.  In short, and without being too mushy (which I doubt I could stand for more than a picosecond), the film does so much right as to make me promote it as a family classic.For those of you with a serous case of TLDR: good presentation and good acting turn a silly movie into a charming one that managed to make my day without even one drop of blood spilled - impressive for a bunch of Vikings.

This can sometimes involve going into a dream within a dream (or more).Much was made of the complexities of this movie and indeed it is complex but for a generation growing up watching Matrix movies (especially the latter two) this is positively straight forward - and that's not a bad thing.

So yes it is complex but at no time did I feel lost either and this is a major plus for the movie.Some other plusses are extremely cool effects in the dream worlds, likable and believable characters whose interactions are fun to watch, effective action scenes, light comedic moments that pop up rarely but never fall flat and a satisfying emotional arc for our main character.  Truly there are many positive aspects to this movie.Some minuses are that it's a bit too long with a few dragging dialog sequences that could probably have been edited down.  This leads to the fact that it does slow down in parts such that you begin to get antsy (not that I have a short attention span but in a world where anything can happen?).  Despite the preceding two sentences I have to admit that all the dialog added to the movie in one way or another.I was a bit distracted by the fact that the dream rules - although meticulously laid out (which is appreciated) - did not always feel like the movie followed to the letter as laid forth.  (possible minor spoilers) For example the rules of time of a dream within a dream, etc. are laid forth but at times things seem to happen way too fast a layer or two in compared with what we know the rules are.  I also understand that the filmmakers wanted a realistic representation but I felt that dreams were - on the whole - rather boring.  I get that these particular dreams were tailor made but they were so orderly it was a bit disconcerting.  No chaos, no random events, unless provoked by the outside world (or only the next layer up),  just cities and buildings and people in suits.  Speaking for myself (but I'm insane) my dreams are a bit more chaotic.  Then again there were a few surprises in there and a few very cool dream fight sequences.Overall, yes, I do recommend this movie.  It's not as complicated as you may initially think but carries its own for sure.  The characters are well developed and the action carried out quite well within a well defined universe.  It is long and you may struggle with some of the rules but overall the movie is rewarding in visuals, story, overall action and emotional depts.  A solid four stars.", "qas": [{"question": "Why is the movie soo confusing?", "id": "c4948fd1938abd35b4079581422fdddd", "answers": [{"text": "is an interesting movie but might not be everyone's cup of tea", "answer_start": 10}, {"text": "the complexities of this movie and indeed it is complex", "answer_start": 435}]}]}, {"context": "Christopher Nolan once again brings us a movie with special effects to dazzle us and brilliant writing to make us think. This is a movie which bears repeat viewings because some of its ideas and plot devices can be complex. You definitely want to watch it when you're prepared to do at least some thinking - it isn't one of those \"turn off your brain\" and be entertained action movies (different movies for different moods). There is a lot to like here, with an excellent cast, wonderful cinematography, some interesting twists, and a core that will make you feel for some of the characters.Cobb (DiCaprio) is an expert at getting into people's minds via their dreams and stealing information. Using a special device, he and some other specialists kidnap and drug the target individual, and then draw them into a dream world of their creation. In the dream they interact with the person and get them to reveal their secrets. All the time, the person's subconscious takes the form of people in the dream world who try to attack the invaders. If any of them die in the dream, they wake up. For some assignments, they actually create a dream within the dream in order to more completely disorient the person and have a better chance of stealing the information. There is also the risk of falling into limbo though, a world created by whoever gets trapped there and where time goes on and on. Limbo can be enticing to some because you have complete control over the world around you. The process of knowingly going into these dreams and sometimes seeing familiar places can cause one to question reality. This is where the movie starts to make you think.Although he gets paid to do this and almost certainly enjoys his work to some degree, what Cobb wants most in life is simply to be able to see his children. Wanted for the murder of his wife Mal - of which he is innocent - Cobb is constantly on the run and cannot return to the U.S. to even see his children. During one of his assignments, he is presented with an offer he can't refuse - plant an idea into someone's mind and a call will be made to clear up the warrant for his arrest. Inception - planting an idea into someone's mind - is much more difficult than stealing information from someone's mind so Cobb puts together a team of experts to accomplish this. One member of the team, Ariadne (Ellen Page), notices that Cobb has some guilt issues which interferes with his ability to perform and even think straight at times. Ariadne pursues it to the point where she finds out what really happened to Mal. This is where the movie starts to make you feel for the characters.The movie includes some great effects sequences and action scenes, including some where Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character is tumbling around the walls of a hotel (with stunts performed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt himself). Filmed on location in cities around the world such as Paris and Tangiers, the cinematography looks amazing both in the real world and in the dreams. A couple of structural devices used by the dream designers look like they're straight out of a M.C. Escher painting.I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a gorgeous science fiction movie which will also make you think. The dreams within dreams plot might get confusing at times, but there is an emotional core which doesn't get lost.", "qas": [{"question": "What do you think about one?", "id": "671321373613be0f2541980796d3a83c", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Unknown to the majority of the populous until late 2009/early 2010, Christopher Nolan was not attempting a directorial debut with Batman Begins, The Prestige, or The Dark Knight. No. He directed said films to gain experience for an idea which had been simmering in his mind for almost a decade:Inception, which was to be his breakthrough as a major feature film director. Though not as highly successful overall as The Dark Knight, which mainly received such favorable reviews because of Heath Ledger's posthumous Academy Award, Inception was a success in its own way: subtly brilliant, with a plot simple enough to comprehend but twisting enough to keep your attention.The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is fantastic. Though perhaps not his best composition work, it definitely earns him a place among his greats. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor as always. Ken Watanabe fully captures the corporate businessman's enigmatic role. Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, and Michael Caine are each persuasive in their own way, making the characters believable as well as drawing the appropriate emotion out of you.The plot is an obvious Nolan brainchild. Who else would compile such a brilliant and stunning script and successfully tie it together for one brilliant finale? Not many.Watch this movie. Find the time: it will be worth your while. Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest director's of our time, and he will be until his career has come to a close.Rated PG-13For Intense Sequences of Violence and Action throughout", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the movie?", "id": "7c1161164fc8f8e8ab1ec2aabdd24346", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This movie is destined to be a CLASSIC.

Get the dual disc edition.]First Impressions:Christopher Nolan put together a very imaginative piece, about the development of a fictitious science that can delve into other people's minds and extract information for government or corporate use - trade secrets and the like.  The story does fall down though in not always making clear to the audience what's going on.  The actors at times mumble their words and the \"moody\" lighting becomes dull and hard to see (although that might just be my TV set).Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb, the mastermind who is an expert at going into others dreams and finding secrets.  Sometimes he can go dreams within dreams.  Unfortunately the clients whose dreams he attempts to invade also have their own constructs and sometimes military force of the subconscious to take care of Cobb and his ilk.Cobb also has a major guilt complex going on.  His wife and he also explored their own inner mind except she thought the \"real\" world was in fact another dream layer and promptly killed herself.  She also created a scenario where he would be on the run from the law for her death -- wow, tough love!All these come together when Cobb is hired out by Saito, a corporate energy dealer who wants to plant an idea (an \"inception\") for Robert Fisher Jr. (Cillian Murphy) to make his own energy business, break it up and thus Saito could then deal with this competitor rather than be relegated to second rate power.To help Cobb ostensibly deal with the architect of the dreams he hires smart girl Ariadne (Ellen Page).  Though she plays her part fairly well, the character is not developed very much.  She does a lot of yelling at the guy, finds out a few of his secrets and rubs his face in his bad decision-making while on the mission (which tends to bend to his guilt), but she's not developed much.  Not a lot of romance or adventure with this character!The others of the team are similarly not well-developed.  After we get to somewhat know them, they're really throwaway characters -- vital to the plot but we don't really invest a lot of emotion into caring if they live or not.Effects:I must say the special effects were amazing.  The attention to detail, every drop of water, every piece of shattered glass, perfectly poised as in real life.  The \"zero gravity\" scene (my word for it) was amazing.  Did they have an actual room they were rotating or what was CGI?Not a lot of fight scenes in the film, although there were plenty of chase scenes in the streets and on the slopes.  The audience is shunted from scene to scene rather quickly, at times too much so.  I found myself rewinding the DVD to see what I just missed.Bottom Line:  Imaginative story, excellent fictitious science of the mind, where even with high technology we still have guilt, misunderstandings and in some cases some pretty blatant attempts at making others wrong to fill a book!  The special effects were great, but the editing was such as to at times confuse and startle.  The dialogue could have been clearer with a few less English accents (though Michael Caine, in the small part he played, was marvelous).Recommended, but you may have to have your finger on the rewind to fully follow what's going on.  The ending was fun, left a question in your mind.Directed byChristopher NolanWriting creditsChristopher Nolan  (written by)Cast (in credits orderLeonardo DiCaprio ...  CobbJoseph Gordon-Levitt ...

Yes, you read that right.  They use brand name objects for advertisement in a film about the apocalypse.  From Ipod to Dr. Dre Beats headphones, there's plenty of shots of how long lasting these items last in the event of human downfall.This brings me to my next point.  What causes this apocalyptic period is completely ignored and is only hinted at throughout the film.  They ignore the setting and causes yet the setting itself is trite and unoriginal.  However, they do hint at what causes this era, but this leads to by far the greatest flaw of this garbage film.The film has such an obvious religious message of Christianity and that by turning away from God and the Bible our society may fall apart in such a fashion as presented in the film.  Spoiler alert: Eli is looking for someone to deliver the Bible to preserve it and feels it can help reestablish society.  Did I need a spoiler alert for that though?  It's so obvious he's referring to the Bible.  Anyway, Eli is meant to be some righteous, god-fearing man, yet he completely contradicts the teachings of his precious Bible.  In the opening scene, he allows a woman to be gang raped because his secrecy and mission is a greater good.  There's no way in hell that Jesus would do something like this nor advocate his actions.  Jesus' ethics were not utilitarian.  Eli's actions are.  The film and the Hughes brothers think they're being subtle and coy with this religious message but it's beyond obvious and feels like they're trying to beat you over the head with their message.  Even then, it seems like they don't know their religion well enough.  They take a more Old Testament route with Eli's character, as well ignore that ethics themselves don't come from God, they misplace and overestimate the value of the Bible to society.  The film just comes off as nearly having an evangelical Christian taint I felt.Denzel's performance is one of the worst in his career as well.  He's a great actor, but maybe it was due to the Hughes brothers' direction (more likely).  It's completely one-note, dull, and plain unlikable.The final major flaw (nearly tied for the worst attribute of the film) is its ending.  They give us another horrible twist that rivals M. Night Shymalan for how bad it is.  It turns out all along Eli is blind!  Oooh!  >_>  As if the film couldn't get any worse, they made Eli blind simply to shock us into wondering how he could've done all the cool (ie crappy) action moves and how he memorized/interpreted the Bible (I think he had a copy in braile) for nothing more than a plot device that seemed only to please fans of The Village or Unbreakable.The ONE positive of this film is Gary Oldman.  The guy is a chameleon and always knows how to make a character come alive.  He makes you really hate and somehow love his character because he's brilliantly devious.  This is due in part to the Hughes brothers too as much as I hate to say it.  They made a character who knows what the Bible can do to people and how it can be used to control the masses.  This was the best thing the film had going for it.I didn't even scratch the surface though on other poor aspects like the action sequences, its Waterworld-like set and costume design (who seriously rips off Waterworld for anything??), the terrible character Milas Kunis has (who takes Eli's reigns after Eli dies at the end for no important reason other than to make simple people feel sad), and its unfitting soundtrack.Seriously, this film is horrible.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the quality of movie?", "id": "517606d94ca437af7f4f892931cc6e8f", "answers": [{"text": "this film has an excessive amount of product placement in it", "answer_start": 14}]}]}, {"context": "This movie was terrible.

Barrie and later on in 1911 in the novel \"Peter and Wendy\" is best known for her appearance in the 1953 Walt Disney film \"Peter Pan\". The character is quite iconic for Disney, as she is quite literally the unofficial mascot for the Walt Disney Company and can be seen in many of their commercials and in 2008, the character received her first animated film which was direct-to-DVD and Blu-ray.After the success of the first \"Tinker Bell\" film in 2008, the whole gang returns for the second film titled \"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure\" in 2009 and now in 2010, Tinker Bell returns with \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" available on Blu-ray+DVD and DVD.VIDEO:\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). If you thought the animation was an improvement with the 2009 release of \"Tinker Bell\", the third film has improved much more. It's so amazing to me, because the people behind the \"Tinker Bell\" films only have so much time to work on them and to see how much the animation has improved between \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" from last year's \"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure\".There is much more detail on the actual characters.  Movements, scenery, water and overall detail has improved as well.  And where the last film focused more on Tinker Bell and Terence within trees and dark set areas, \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" is much different as they are outdoors and we see how the weather changes from sunny, to rain storm and then to night, so we get to see separate environments from within the cottage to the outdoors.Every character is vibrant with colors, sharp and everything is quite detailed including the skin of the characters. You actually see Tinker Bell's cheeks having some color and also the skin pigments of other characters as well. It's much more defined it seems compared to last year's characters.  May it be more focus on the skin maps and textures or technology upgrades, everything about this latest Tinker Bell film looks much better than its last two predecessors.And I can continue to list so many positives from the plants, the clothing, the accessories and the beautiful backgrounds, the lush green grass, the water effects, the trees and even the animals are well detailed with their hair effects. Also, the special effects via CG from the lighting effects utilizing the pixie dust and then my favorite, the animated facial expressions, is just definitely great to look at. Although not a big budget theatrical film, \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" looks absolutely beautiful.Granted, it's important to note that this is a direct-to-video film and that the animators have a short time making these films compared to the bigger budget Pixar releases.  So, by no means do I want to say that \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" is going to meet the same animation quality of larger budget animated film such as \"Toy Story 3' or \"Up\" but having seen how this film series develop and knowing the animators have only so much time, I give them credit for what they are able to accomplish within a year's time.  For a direct-to-video film, \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" looks great!  So, for the most part, this High Definition transfer of the film is absolutely pristine and gorgeous to look at. Another solid Walt Disney release on Blu-ray!As for the accompanying DVD, the film is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced or 169 Televisions.AUDIO:As for the audio, the audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and all sound effects come alive. Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channel, as is the beautiful orchestral music. Good use of the surround channels as the flow of sounds from the action sequences can be heard all around. From the ambiance of the workers at Fair Camp to the thumps and crashes of pans during a scene in the kitchen or in Lizzy's bedroom.  Also, good use of surrounds during the storms and you can hear the rain pattering as well as hearing the cars from the distance as they get closer to the fairies. Overall, a well-done lossless soundtrack.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.The DVD, the film comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound soundtrack with English SDH, French and Spanish language tracks.SPECIAL FEATURES\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue \" comes with the following special features presented in 1080p and 480i, English and French Dolby Digital and subtitles that are in English SDH, French and Spanish:* Tangled - Exclusive Sneak Peak- (3:39) A special early look at Walt Disney's upcoming animated film \"Tangled\".

No friends and her father is literally busy with his research and has no time for her.  So, she is attached to Tinker Bell and for her to believe that fairies are real, is simply a wonderful time for her but also knowing that Tinker Bell can't stay with her.So, you have that emotional component to this film but then you have Vidia and friends (who we have seen in the previous films) who participate in the more adventure-parts of the film.  We see how these fairies need to rescue Tinker Bell (as they fear humans) and because of the rain storm and their wings are wet, they can't fly or use their fairy magic.  So, they have to depend on using what they have and trying to make a boat and get from the summer camp to the cottage where they think Tinker Bell is being held in a cage against her will.I really enjoyed this third film and it's a great family film and in my opinion, it's the best Tinker Bell film of the three films thus far.  An improvement in storyline, more characters (and utilization of characters) and also a major improvement of characters and various scenery in different weather conditions and thus various, colorful scenes.\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" will attract younger and older audiences with its friendly screenplay and beautiful animation and music. The majority of all fairy characters (primarily Tinker Bell's friends) are back and overall, it was a very enjoyable film. The Blu-ray definitely continues Disney's commitment for the best quality for their High Definition releases (again, picture and audio quality are both magnificent) and there's really nothing to be disappointed with this release at all. Also, included is a DVD for the kids or for long commutes as well.Parents who are wondering if this film is scary at all, there really are no scary parts.  You have your usual cat who looks mean and wants to eat Tinker Bell and friends but really, there is nothing scary about this film at all.  And most importantly, you do not need to watch the previous two films to enjoy the third.  Although, it will help in knowing the relationship that Tinker Bell has with characters like Vidia or Terrence or what is fairy dust by watching the previous two films, but they are not really essential to enjoying the third film.Overall, if you are a looking for a Disney animated release for your children (especially those who love fairies) and for the whole family, \"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\" is highly recommended!", "qas": [{"question": "What is the name of the movie where the actor has a rude heart ?", "id": "89e04e939c83a30fabe9b51860fbea1d", "answers": [{"text": "Tinker Bell", "answer_start": 0}]}]}]}, {"title": "B003ES5JDS", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Batman: Under the Red Hood was better than I thought it would be, the animation was good but not great, and the story was very good.

The Reaping is approaching fast and Primrose is frightened she will be chosen even though it will be the first time her name is in the drawing. When Prim's name is called, Katniss volunteers as tribute to take part in the Hunger Games, where 2 young people (boy and girl, aged 12 to 18) from each of the 12 districts fight to the death for prestige and goods for their district. Only one victor survives. Katniss is plunged into a completely different world where being memorable and likeable will mean her survival. She will do what it takes to survive, but will it be enough?I read The Hunger Games a couple of years ago and it was never my favorite in the series. I felt it was a Battle Royale ripoff and the later books explored the dystopic world better and went beyond the obvious comparisons between the two works. This film made me forget all that. I was completely blown away and I really want to watch it about 20 more times. I haven't felt like this about a movie in a really long time. The ensemble cast was amazing, giving believable portrayal of characters I feel I know very well after reading 3 books about them. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen acted wonderfully. She always had an air of sadness yet responsibility. She made the tough heroine believable and relatable because her emotions were close beneath the surface despite her hard exterior. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket provided much needed humor that alleviated the emotion and drama of the story. The other most notable actors were Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (more comic relief and makes Katniss realize the gravity of the reality TV aspect) and Isabel Fuhrman as Clove (sociopath and career tribute that left me with a chill every time she was onscreen).This film did 3 things extremely well that made it one of the best book to film transitions I've ever seen: capturing the emotions, humanizing the otherwise unlikeable characters, and working out timing. Two scenes in particular were very emotional for me.  The scene where Katniss volunteers as tribute for her sister was absolutely heartwrenching even though I had seen at least some of the scene hundreds of times in the past month from the commercials. The other scene that made me bawl like a baby was when Rue died. It was so sudden it took me a few moments for her death to process. I had cried at the scene in the book, but it's different seeing it on the screen. It was captured perfectly and there wasn't a dry eye in my theater. The other tributes were well humanized despite being portrayed as villains, especially the career tributes. Marvel at the end made a speech about how even he won he would be doomed because the Games are all he was good for. It showed that the other tributes aren't the real villains; President Snow and all those that perpetuate these sadistic Games are. I was surprised at how well the film flowed from scene to scene. About half of the film was dedicated to portraying the world, the assessing of the tributes, and the reality television aspect of the Games. The Games took up the latter half. I was never bored and I never thought any of the scenes ran too long. Although every single scene of the book wasn't included in the film, the essential scenes were preserved and given a satisfying amount of time.The most important triumph of this film was that I was never distracted by analyzing each and every difference from the novel. I was completely immersed in the cruel and depressing world of The Hunger Games and wondered at the characters' capacity for hope in the face of a bleak totalitarian regime. The only drawback at all was the shaky cam got a little extreme at points. Usually I'm against it on principle, but it let the film keep a gritty edge without pushing the boundaries into rated R territory by showing graphic scenes of children killing each other. I did not consider this book the best in the series and this movie was simply amazing. I can't wait to see what great films will be made of Catching Fire and Mockingjay.", "qas": [{"question": "How faithful is this film to the bible version?", "id": "17daa0e1c90796a18ed62af886e1ff58", "answers": []}, {"question": "How is the movie?", "id": "a94f357c1384090ad450bbe2b67e6944", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This movie is a dystopian view of our world in which teenagers are served up as a kind of \"Roman Coliseum\" story in which they fight to the death for their individual districts with the game being rigged to boot.

To begin with there is the task of bringing the entire story that most would read over a period of say a week and turning it into a something that takes a little over 2 hours. Then there are the fans. When you have a book as popular as THE HUNGER GAMES, those fans can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Everyone has their favorite thing about the book they love and not all will make it to the final product. Fans that have yet to see the movie should know there are changes but that the movie is still wonderful.The story takes place in the future where after a tumultuous war the continent has been divided into districts. Each district is responsible for its own product which for the most part is taken to the Capitol. As a tribute and a reminder of their defeat by those in the Capitol a yearly competition is held called the Hunger Games. A boy and girl, ages 12-18, are selected from each district. They are wined, dined and trained for a few days then set free in an area designated for the games. The way to win is to kill the other 23 contestants.The focus of the story revolves around Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman who hunts illegally to keep her family fed and taken care of. This year is the first that her young sister Prim must enter her name. The odds are against her name being drawn but when it is, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the son of the local baker. The two are allowed their goodbyes to friends and family and then whisked away to the Capitol.On their train trip to the Capitol both Katniss and Peeta are given instruction from their two mentors. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) is the prim and proper example of what the Capitol is all about: excess in nearly every area and blindly obedient to the President (Donald Sutherland). Their other mentor, clearly the better of the two, is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). Haymitch is a past winner who has knowledge of the games first hand. He also drinks non-stop in an effort to get through the knowledge that perhaps these two might not make it home again.With the story set up we get to the Capitol and witness the transformation of Katniss and Peeta from backwoods teens whose names were drawn to contestants who must not only be physically fit but must win the favor of viewers and wealthy sponsors who can help them with gifts throughout the games. It is their best chance for survival but Katniss hates the games and what they represent. Still, several incidents occur that win her favor in some circles.The day arrives and the contestants are set free to do bodily harm to one another. Backpacks with special equipment are left for them to take if they can avoid being stabbed or worse by other contestants. As the person with the best skills and chance of surviving, Katniss sets out to find a way to win taking as few lives as possible. When the rules are changed to allow both competitors from each district survive as a team, she must find Peeta who proclaimed his love for her during a pre-game interview. Together they might have a chance to make it out of the Hunger Games alive.Movie fans of the film BATTLE ROYALE will raise a stink that this film has taken its idea from that one. Nothing could be further from the truth. While the battling teens are similar, the way the games are handled is much different. But more important is the story of Katniss who changes as she makes her way through the games. Cold and hard at first, she comes to find romance and a caring soul among those she fights next to and against. It is a coming of age story that shows a young woman forced to reach maturity beyond her years.The movie has a great look stretching from the coal mining scenes that form the world of District 12 where Katniss is from to the over-glamorized appearance of the Capitol. These are two different worlds on the same planet and the reactions of Peeta and Katniss show that they've never seen anything outside their front door. It doesn't mean that they admire this new world; they just recognize it is different.The acting is straight forward here. No one seems to be hamming it up or overplaying their roles. Each one comes across as the person they are here to represent which would seem easier for lesser known actors and much more difficult for those who are seasoned professionals. All included in this film turn in admirable jobs.Knowing that the books are a trilogy one could be afraid that the end of this film would leave you hanging on the edge, waiting for the next. Don't be afraid. This movie would stand on its own if it had to. But once you become a fan my guess is you'll anxiously anticipate the next or perhaps you'll begin reading the books. In any event, THE HUNGER GAMES is a movie that will have you thinking, talking with friends and considering the implications. And more than anything it will entertain you.", "qas": [{"question": "How solid are the characters in this picture?", "id": "ae76161b4d2a0639c5aa6604fcc9b490", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I have never read the books, so my review is based solely on the movie.The movie starts out slow.  Some people will call it character building, but there was not much of that.  It was mainly just about training for the \"Games\".It was not until the battle scenes that the movie got better.  I love action films.  I grew up in the eighties watching Arnold and Sylvester.  I do not care so much about a plot.  I just want to be entertained.  This part of the movie certainly did that for me.The romance seemed forced and the ending was cheesy.  I won't give it away.  There was enough in this film to keep me wanting to watch part 2 when it comes out.  I think, like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies, the second film will be much better than the first for action seekers like me.I must say that Jennifer Lawrence really has good onscreen presence.

But it makes you look at a potentially real dark side of the human concept of entertainment in a garish and mocking manner.  The mocking element is probably why I give it a 4 instead of a 3.

The score is also very good.There are some parts of the movie that I didn't care for due to small changes from the book, but you will have that with any adaption, and there was some moments when the cameras seemed to be unnecessarily shaky.

Before going in I had no idea what to expect from this film except teenagers killing teenagers in a dis-utopian world sometime in the future. I had no knowledge of the story, the characters, the world this film is set in, nothing at all.Now that that's out of the way, I would like to also state that going into this film I had my reservations. When people you know have probably never read a book in their life they weren't forced to read start raving about a young adults novel than you know something's up. Leading up to the release of this film that is exactly what happened. People I know to never read came to me telling me how great this series is, how exited they were for the film, how edgy, deep, and emotional it all is. Warning flags went up in my head. This had Twilight written all over it. A young adult series about teenagers fighting to the death might sound edgy and original, but unless done right it can be neither.Sometime in the future (near or far, we're never told) a war breaks out within \"The Country\" where 12 districts rebel against the central government and are brutally crushed. Little back story is given to this war, but we are told that it was bloody. The Country, from its capital aptly named The Capital, wins \"The War\" against \"The Districts\" and imposes upon these humbled and defeated people a treaty that states every year a boy and a girl ages 12 to 17 will fight to the death in \"The Hunger Games\" as punishment. Cause you know, making the kids of conquered people fight to the death is a real fine way to pacify them. The absurdity of this premise is plain enough to see. Taking the children of your defeated countrymen and forcing them to kill each other is not a very sane strategy of pacifying the population. As demonstrated in the film itself all it does is lead to riots and anger towards \"The Country.\" Unlike in like-minded stories such as Stephen Kings \"The Running Man\" or \"The Long Walk\" these games do not carry universal appeal; they are not used primarily as a means to entertain the masses and keep them happy but to punish the treasonous districts even 72 years after the fact, long after those who started The War have passed on. From what is shown the Districts have no love for the games, and indeed hate them as they should, so they serve only to arouse hatred and anger against the government. Why, after 72 years even a totalitarian government would risk riots and revolt every year just to put on a set of games defies logic. Much harsher punishment is inflicted every day in the form of starvation, terrible working and living conditions, and an electric fence system that herds the people into towns like cattle. The games are unnecessary as punishment and only incite violence towards the government. I can see it now, the heroes of this film rising up against the bad guys to take them down, all because of some idiotic games.The plot does indeed sound edgy, but it is hardly the only work of art I've seen to depict children being killed for sport or killing others. Stephen Kings \"The Long Walk\" and the anime series \"Gunslinger Girls\" have similar premises but execute their respective idea's in a much deeper and emotional fashion than does Hunger Games. At the end of the day both those works of art were written for a much older audience while Hunger Games was written for teenagers, and it defiantly shows. In a movie like this you expect to see carnage and brutality that not only tugs at the heartstrings but also shows us the real evil of such a system. The actual games take up about a quarter of the film and even then very little actual violence is shown. The opening fight scene is a slow motion blur of kids running around, screaming, and smearing the camera with terrible looking fake blood. The film pussyfoots around its brutal premise in order to avoid the R rating it by all rights should have received, which, in the end, effectively negates the shock and horror I should have felt while watching. I felt that horror while reading The Long Walk; I had that shock when I watched Gunslinger Girls; all I felt watching The Hunger Games was boredom. The fights weren't even exiting. I'm sorry, but blurry and dark close up fights where I can't even tell what the hell is going on is NOT exiting. Give me a break.And don't even get me started on the love story. It's as if the makers of this film thought their audience too shallow and stupid to fully grasp the deeper implications of the main plot and so they through in an idiotic teen romance to spice things up. No it does not reach Twilight bad, but at least Twilight was a romance from the start and wasn't advertised as anything different; The Hunger Games are a complete different beast entirely. Reading reviews and descriptions of this film I was led to expect a tale of defiance, of fighting back against incredible odds, of sticking it to the man. None of that happens. No one fights back, no one speaks out against the system or comments on how terrible killing children is. No one defies the government or anyone. Instead we are given a clich&eacute; teenager romance. In fact, hardly anyone seems to have trouble taking another person's life in this movie, not even the main character. Twelve to seventeen year olds murder one another like hardened criminals with little regard for life and hardly any fear. Grown men would be pissing themselves at the prospect of being murdered gladiator style. Most of these kids hardly blink. The entire movie I was waiting for our hero's to resist, to fight back, to do anything really that the establishment didn't want them to do. SPOILER: Trying to commit suicide at the end doesn't exactly count.The movies not all bad though. For the most part the acting is pretty decent, although most characters besides the lead stick mostly to stereotypes and clich&eacute;'s at least the stereotypes and clich&eacute;'s are decently acted. They all wear ridiculous costumes and make up, live in idiotic looking houses, and love watching kids kill each other. What a world, what a world.I honestly don't understand the love for this movie. It's okay I guess, but hardly worth all the hype and love its received. Just another silly movie aimed to please silly teenagers.

However, the plot of the Hunger Games is rather weak. Predicting the future has always been a stumbling block for most science fiction writers. We've seen plenty of versions regarding how terrible the future will be... going all the way back to Huxley and Wells. This one divides the country (I presume it is America) into the very wealthy and the very poor, with one poor person given the chance to survive a publically broadcast games that pit children against one another until only one is left standing. This is about as likely as never happening. The premise is so weak as to make the rest of the movie a joke. Supporting performances are also weak. The film relies almost entirely on special effects and the performances of Lawrence and veteran Donald Sutherland. While I love science fiction, I found the end did not justify the means. The plot is weak throughout and solution is open ended, hence Hunger Games, two - will Jennifer end up with her true boyfriend; will she have to volunteer for the games again (she'd have to survive because I believe there is a book three!!!!).

The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies.  The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion.  Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or `reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner.  The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment.  There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters.  Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother.  She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her.  When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide.  The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role).  When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland.  Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way.  You root for her and feel her pain.  Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see.  Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences?This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite.  If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man.  Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One.  The sacrificial humans are dubbed `tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. \"War is Peace\".While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup.  Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement.

Art direction is superb, especially on the details of economic inequality.The maybe not so much points:Some of the CGI is a little transparent.  The political background is important but never explained.Practical Matters:If you are looking at reviews of this movie right now, it may be because you are wondering whether you need to see it before you see the sequel (s).  As of this writing, (Catching Fire is available for home viewing; Mockingjay is not out yet), no.  You won't be lost if you watch Catching Fire first.  However, I do recommend that you watch The Hunger Games for its own sake, just because it is a really good movie, and because it increases the emotional payoffs of the sequels.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the movie?", "id": "cc10b498f673751bc09147ef6c2b5499", "answers": [{"text": "is a really good movie", "answer_start": 1111}, {"text": "You", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, {"context": "And by \"Ages\" I mean all time as well as people of all ages. I was not familiar with the books and had never even heard of the title until this last spring when news of it was everywhere. I thought \"hmm...sounds like another movie targeted at tweens/teens like the Twilight movies\". Boy was I wrong!!! Twilight is not even in the same league as this movie and will fade away over time. What makes this movie so great is the story as well as the great acting. This movie is destined to become a CLASSIC in the mold of Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and other 'totalitarian state\" movies/books. The story is eerily like where the world actually appears headed...where the elite 1% have 99% of the wealth and everyone else shares the remaining 1% of the wealth. And hence, the depiction of the decadence of the rich and their disdain for \"the masses\" really hits home and builds up our emotional \"involvement\" in the movie. Clearly, the author was shooting to sensitive us to the dangers of where we are headed. Anyway, the movie plot/story really feeds on this \"us vs them\" dynamic and does so brilliantly. What could be worse than the 1% demanding a \"tribute\" in the form of taking our children to die in a gory spectacle for their evil pleasure? The acting in this movie is superb by both the veterans and new-comers. The two main protagonists are both very appealing and you really want them to pull through. Donald Sutherland as the \"king\" of the 1% plays his role to evil perfection. And Woody....sleeper for best supporting actor? Too many great performance to list here. The cinematography is excellent and the scenes of battle/conflict are grim and realistic. And the feelings of young adults faced with being thrust into such a situation are played well. And lastly, the actress who plays Katniss is so \"hot\" that my new LCD TV almost melted. Another actress in this role and the movie would be still be good. But Jennifer puts this movie over the top...perfect casting. I have never been so wrong about a movie going in relative to the hype and what I expected to see. 11 out of 10!!!", "qas": [{"question": "How is the actor?", "id": "9ca62c6b9d04f7d38405cd3ccdd7e4d9", "answers": [{"text": "The acting in this movie is superb", "answer_start": 1236}]}]}, {"context": "The Hunger Games is the start of another franchise of movies based a series of teen books.  However, I did not think the movie was that bad, but actually quite good.  I do not think it is as good as the Lord of the Rings films, Narnia films, or the Harry Potter films, but still fairly enjoyable.  Compared to the string of teen fantasy movies that have come out recently like Percy Jackson or Twilight this movie is god.The story is pretty simple.  It takes place in the distant future.  There was once a big civil war which has left North America in ruins.  Instead of countries there now exists twelve districts.  Each year the capital of Panem forces either a boy or a girl from each district to compete in the Hunger Games where they all battle to the death.  From District 12 a girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is chosen to compete along with her friend/love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth).People accuse this film of ripping of another film called Battle Royale.  Firstly I have not seen Battle Royale so I cannot say which film is better.  Secondly, I'm sure that Battle Royale was not the first of its kind either.  Everything is inspired by something.  There have been movies and TV shows that have come out after this that have a similar premise of people put somewhere and are forced to fight to the death.  For all anime fans out there, there is an anime that came out last year (the same year that the Hunger Games came out) called Btooom that has pretty much the same premise yet I do not see many people complaining that that show ripped-off Battle Royale.Plus the film is still well structured, well, acted, and can be entertaining.  The characters are pretty solid.  I do like Katniss and it is easy to sympathize with her given the situation.  The stuff that she goes through is pretty scary and intense.  I can say that I would be dead in the first ten minutes if I was put in the Hunger Games.The movie has some great effects, decent actions scenes, and an interesting world.  I cannot comment on the 3D because I only saw the film in 2D.  There is one complaint I have and that is the middle portion.  I found much of the middle of the film to be kind of boring.  The middle mostly focuses of the political aspect of this world and preparing Katniss for the games.Overall, the Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise.  I did not expect much upon going to see it.  I basically saw it because my mother made me see it.  I have to admit it was much better than I thought it was going to be.  It was nothing incredible but it was still good.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the maximimum productions of the company?", "id": "9706d97eb68707769b1d838f08845aa4", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B003FBNJ4U", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This week I watched both this Swedish Blu-Ray and saw the just-released American remake in the theater, and I have read the first two books.I rate both versions at five stars--great films. There is 5.1 Dolby Digital in Swedish with the option of dubbed English dialog. I watched the Swedish language version with English subtitles, although the English dubbing did seem pretty good. The quality of sound and picture on the Blu-Ray is excellent.This Swedish film is closer to the book in detail and in dramatic portrayal. The scenery seemed more stark and cold, and the murders more appalling. Lizbeth's propensity for violence is better portrayed, and as the film progresses we get better insight into why Lizbeth is socially dysfunctional than in the American version. The reporter, Blomkvist, spends three months in jail in the Swedish version, but no jail time in the American version, and his humiliation is therefore all the greater.Noomi Repaces's Lizbeth is harsher than that of Rooney Mara in the American version and therefore more effective. Rooney Mara's amazing beauty inevitably softens her character in the American version even though her acting is excellent. The fate of the dead niece, Harriet, is far closer to the book in the Swedish version and has more dramatic impact.Noomi Repaces's dragon tattoo covers her back and is truly formidable. After all, the tattoo is the point of the title.There are many other gratuitous discrepancies in the American version that detract from the drama that made Larsson's book so powerful.Blomquist is portrayed as the same sharp researcher and unaware babe-magnet in both films. Michael Nyqvist and Daniel Craig both give excellent performances--true to Larsson's character--with Craig having the edge.If you are comfortable with subtitles, then this Swedish version might be your best choice, especially if you have already read the novel. If you prefer a more American style movie with well-known, somewhat better looking, Hollywood actors; especially if you have not read the book; then the American version may be your best choice.

(Also, if you liked &#34;L.A. Law,&#34; this may be the show for you -- there are many similarities in structure.) This is Margulies' star vehicle and she takes it and runs with it. Her character is strong, but just vulnerable enough to keep her from being a caricature. I won't give a plot outline -- you can look that up elsewhere. Just know that each week a new legal case keeps the character and her cronies on the run both physically and intellectually, often trying to beat deadlines and/or keep one step ahead of the bad guys (usually the State's Attorney's office, where a disgruntled ex-employee seems hell-bent on destroying his former firm in general and Alicia Florrick specifically). Playing in the background of the title character's foray back into law -- necessitated by her politician-husband's arrest involving allegations of ill-gotten gains and a hooker named Amber -- we have his story of politics and candidacy; we have their husband-wife story (can they find their way back to each other after his betrayal?); we have their family story (they have two adolescent kids who are, by TV standards, amazingly NOT annoying or precocious at all); and we have her work relationships. At any given time, a lot is going on, and the writing is clever enough to pull all of the plot threads together into a lovely, lively, cohesive macrame of entertainment. The show is peopled with an array of interesting characters, including the tough-smart senior partner (played to snooty perfection by the we-love-her-so-much Christine Baranski), not one but two mysterious and gleefully unethical private investigators (Archie Panjabi, &#34;Bend It Like Beckham,&#34; and Scott Porter, &#34;Friday Night Lights&#34;), an attractive partner with whom Margulies' character shares a Past and a lot of intense temptation, The Husband (it's Mr. Big!), an evil State's Attorney (played most appropriately by the actor who played The Devil in &#34;Lost&#34;), and a fun variety of well-known guest stars in recurring roles as attorneys and judges (Meryl Streep's kid, Michael J. Fox, Jane Alexander for heaven's sake!). On the down side, there are a disproportionate number of Hollywood-thin, hot, 20-something female lawyers on the series (recurring or guest shots), all with in-your-face designer wardrobes and attitudes to match. I worked in law for 30 years and, believe me, in real life, even young, female attorneys come in different shapes and sizes, and their wardrobes are far more Ross than Armani. Speaking of age, Margulies is approaching 50. Since women are constantly judged on how well they're tallying up the years, let me say that she looks amazing on this show and, except perhaps for some eye work (it's hard to tell because her character wears a great deal of black eye makeup on the show, even to bed), it doesn't look like she's had plastic surgery. Why is this important to mention? Because when female stars start going under the knife -- sadly, forced into it by a profession that insists upon eternal youth -- they often lose their essential selves. I'm happy to report that Margulies is still Margulies and, even though she's traded in her mass of curly locks for a shiny straight 'do, watching her, you can imagine that Alicia Florrick is Nurse Carol Hathaway, all grown up and working her magic in law instead of medicine.", "qas": [{"question": "How is character?", "id": "5aa1265a8e7696afb812081bc930fba5", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B003L20ICE", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I found this movie to be very well-acted and well-directed.The sexual scenes didn't bother me not one bit, like some of the other reviewers.I mean, COME ON!!---This is life in the 21st Century!--Grow up already!People get naked and they interact, okay?---Thank goodness that computers and gadgetshaven't spoiled that for us (yet!), as it has with basic conversational skills and other formsof by-gone or slowly dying human interaction.I actually know both a lesbian couple, as well as a gay male couple whoare living similar circumstances as in the premise of this movie.I found it very modern, refreshing, and mature in it's approach to the subject matter.I have long been a fan of Mark Ruffalo, Julianne Moore and Annette Benning's work,and I also thought \"the kids\" themselves did an excellent job at portraying their roles.My problem was in that I felt like the Mark Ruffalo character kind of had his once happyand balanced, (for him), life just upheaved and torn apart when he gets contacted by these \"kids\",who of course, have every right to know who their father / donor was, and also what his background is.Ruffalo's character had a great attitude (I thought) about the whole thing...He was naturally pensive and cautious at first, though not in a malicious way, but soon warmed to theidea that he had these \"kids\" in his life now, and was more than open to getting to know them, and allowthem to get to know him. I felt that Annette Benning's character, who felt threatened, in addition to justbeing an anal-retentive, controlling witch with a capital B, was very mean and cold towards Ruffalo's character.Julianne Moore's character was a bit of a messy, confused, psychological user.Moore's character is that kind of person who is filled with inner turmoil or frustration, but makes it everybodyelse's problem around her. I hated how she treated the latino gardener too, just because she felt guiltyabout all of the drama and calamity that she was causing in her affair with Ruffalo's character!I always say: \"Don't jump in the river, if you're not a strong swimmer, babe!\" (-:Ruffalo's character was the perfect outlet for her pent up sexual confusion / tension,and the two (again) enter into a very complicated and torrid affair, which of course, couldonly end in heartache for all concerned.  As soon as Moore's character quenches her sexual thirst/curiosity,she just basically returns back to her life relationship Benning's character and the \"kids\",after she and Ruffalo's character are found out, and they all seem to throw Ruffalo's character under the bus...As if to say, \"Okay babe, we've all uprooted you from your life, and now we're done with ya!--So ummmm---kay, bye!\"This kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, as Ruffalo's character is literally lefton the outside looking in, as Benning & Moore & the kids reunion-reconnection happens without him.He is locked out of their lives...Lives that he really never knew exsisted in the first place,until they invaded his, satiated their curiosity, and sent him packing.Not cool, I felt. )-:Not saying that Ruffalo's character was a saint or anything, but the man had his own businessand his own life...as unorthodox as it was...but then again, wasn't Benning, Moore and the kids' livesjust as unorthodox? I guess I just wished that a balance could've been reached between all parties,and it could've ended on that note, instead of Ruffalo's character, who btw, he played with a great spirit& optimism, being dejected and disregarded.

That must be the film stock though. A New Hope looks so good I gave away my limited edition theatrical version on DVD. Who gives a crap who shot who first, this HD is amazing!! Plus the Han/Greedo scene is improved and feels slightly more ruthless than the Special Edition on DVD.I don't care about the changes. I like Vader saying \"No.\" It makes sense because he has regained his humanity.You get 2 fun and entertaining films (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)Phantom Menace is the most improved film here, blowing the DVD transfer out the water and replacing the rubber looking Yoda with CGI Yoda, fixing continuity with the other prequels. I felt as if I was watching this film for the first time. Magical.The bonus disc that covers the original trilogy is awesome.However not all the deleted scenes have high replay valueone deleted scene from A New Hope is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the Toshi Station scene. Great character development here!!!one deleted scene from Empire Strikes Back is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the scene showing Luke and Leia almost sharing a very deep and passionate kiss after he was rescued by Han. This scene would have made it a completely different movie!!!Three deleted scenes from Return of the Jedi should have made the final cut, one showing Vader telepathically calling Luke as he creates his new light saber, the sand storm scene had good character development and shows Luke's wounded hand from rescuing Han, and a scene where Vader strangles an officer who says the Palpatine doesn't want to see anyone.All the new overviews and interviews were great.Bonus disc for Prequels is great too, EVEN THOUGH DELETED SCENES FROM DVD EDITION WERE NOT INCLUDED, SO HOLD ONTO YOUR BONUS DISCS!!!!!!!!!!!New deleted scenes for Phantom Menace all sucked, completely worthlessTwo new deleted scenes for Attack of the Clones were great, one dealing with Dooku's origin and another dealing with Anakin losing his memory of his mother. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!One new deleted scene for Revenge of the Sith was great, dealing with Palaptine further seducing Anakin into the dark side. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!All the new overviews and interviews for prequels were great.Bonus disc with documentaries and spoofs was a mixed bag, especially if you own the awesome \"Empire of Dreams\" documentary from the dvd release. All the docs for the old trilogy didn't cover anything new that \"Empire of Dreams\" did and were boring. If you haven't seen Empire of Dreams you should, otherwise you might like these docs.Spoofs was the best thing about this disc, freaking hilarious!!!Star Wars Gadgets doc on technology was okay. i'd never watch it again.documentary on the 501st was okay, i'd never watch it againEmpire strikes back 30 years later was the best Doc but not essential, it's hard to top Empire of Dreams in my eyes.The only bad thing to this set is...The case flat out SUCKS!! Don't like sliding my disc in and out of sleeves, even if blu rays are more scratch resistant, i don't care...I used my old DVD cases and switched out the DVD's with the Blu rays. Feels more secure and guarantee to not get scratched!So, this is a great set, just switch the cases with your dvd set and keep your bonus disc from the dvd's!!!I wouldn't buy this set for the list price of $140.Amazon price is okay, $80, but I got it for $70 used.

The book is truly about treating people with respect and kindness. There's one line towards the end of the book that sums it up perfectly on page 492 of the book, \"Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought.\" The movie should have concentrated more on the relationships between the women instead of nearly eclipsing that with the circumstances during those times. The circumstances were more of the background of the story, it was the women's attitudes towards one another, their bond, their courage--all of that made the book what it was. The movie merely glossed over those and made the connection between the women nearly obsolete.I don't expect the writers and directors of films to please everyone with the outcome, but sometimes, like with this movie, it seems they barely even try. When movies like \"It's A Wonderful Life\" was being adapted into films, script after script was rejected and rewritten before they came up with something satisfactory. Now? It seems they accept the first one simply because it has a beginning and an end and then idiots pat them on the back. All this director did was pull a bunch of lines from the book and arranged them. Not only that, he BUTCHERED some of the secondary plots. I'll give you examples:1) Octavia Spencer WAS Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain WAS the Miss Celia I'd pictured. They are both incredible actresses. But their parts were so limited, I felt as though their characters were cheated. The scene when Celia miscarried could have been more intense, so could her meeting with Johnny, but the thing that pissed me off the most was that I believe one of the most VITAL parts of the book were left out of the film. There was a part in the book where Minny tries to protect herself and Celia from a crazy man that came onto their property and in the end Celia is the one that ends up fending the attacker from Minny, basically saving her help's life.  It also showed their true relationship--that Celia FELT something for Minny. The part when a doctor had to be called when Celia lost her baby and was hemorrhaging badly and Minny was the one who called him was the actual proof that Minny had once saved her life. Yet, there was no such scene in the movie.2) Why bother saying that Minny even had an abusive husband in the first place if the idiot writer was just going to act like sitting at a table seeing some food gave her enough courage to leave him? Huh? Really? His point was she'd taught her white boss how to cook so somehow that translated into her taking all of her kids and leaving a man she's been with it seems for probably 20 years and put up with his crap all that time and all of a sudden it's only now sitting at a table looking at good food is going to give her the gumption to go. The sad part is, people don't even scream that this is insulting the audiences' intelligence--everybody seems to be going along with everything this movie is and not saying a thing no matter how ridiculous this film made it seem.3) Constantine's story in the movie makes little to no sense at all. There are so many vital elements left out of that story it's a shame; and the parts that the writer of the movie put in are simply an embarrassment. The movie just made Constantine's daughter look haughty and disrespectful and that's not how she should've been depicted at all. Lulabelle was Constantine's daughter's name in the book, but apparently in the screen adaption, \"Rachel\" was somehow more appropriate *shrugs* (As if Mae Mobley didn't sound like a ridiculous name? If you're going to keep a baby named Mae Mobley, why not keep Lulabelle?), but she was just as much a victim of circumstance as any of the other women and she had a reason to be angry as well. She didn't just barge into Charlotte's house for no reason at all. Charlotte's role in the movie was also changed--she was vicious and vindictive when it came to Constantine between the pages of the book and Charlotte really did do her wrong, but we get none of that in the movie.I'm glad I read the book first because I'm not sure what my reaction would've been had I seen this watered down movie version. Knowing the back story for the characters and their situations was its only saving grace for me. Was the majority of the acting terrific? Yes, it was. Was it shot beautifully? Indeed, it was. Was the script poorly written? I must say, it was.The real story, the one you find between the pages of the book in which this movie was based on, is ugly and powerful and wonderful all at the same time. It'll make you laugh and cry--and this is coming from someone who didn't even want to read the book at first. The book is about women and their friendships with one another, women and their relationships with their children, women and their relationships with the help they have in their household, women and their relationships with themselves. Race comes secondary when it comes to the real story found in the book. The movie was more flashy than anything with Lafayette from True Blood (don't get me wrong, I love Nelsan Ellis, and he's amazingly talented, but it's almost gimmicky to have certain actors in films nowadays and his part kind of felt that way even though he was flawless). Also the character given to Leslie Jordan (known for his role on Will and Grace as Beverley Leslie) came off that way as well--gimmicky (esp with the cartwheel he did at the Benefit, I believe it was). That character was meant to be a chunky hard around the edges kinda guy, but he was funny.Most people are screaming that this movie is sooooo great, and it really isn't. It's mediocre at best.

Got all that?Why don't we see the dances you ask?  Because whenever a dance starts our hero goes into a fantasy trance and we are transported into a dream sequence where her and her fellow dancers take on zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, etc.  For example, one of the items that they need to steal is a lighter.  Therefore, the fantasy sequence involves the squad of women cutting the throat of a baby dragon, ripping out two fire crystals, and then a chase sequence with the mother dragon.I'll admit that the fantasy parts are pretty well done.  However, after the first two I found myself asking - \"Is this all there is?

J. Abrams did for the third installment (Abrams is here as a producer).  The result is a fun romp filled with thrills, chills, and quite a bit of laughter.  (The centerpiece, Hunt hanging off the tallest building in the world, is capped by one of the most well-timed one-liners in recent memory.)  It's more or less what you expect from this series; if you liked the first three (we'll forgive you for not liking the second film, however), you'll like GHOST PROTOCOL.  It's no-apologies-necessary entertainment, plain and simple.  It has the great action sequences, the improbable technology and plot points (only Tom Cruise would drive a convertible at high speed during a sandstorm), that we secretly hope for every time we sit down before an action film.What sets GHOST PROTOCOL above your typical flick of this type is the way it handles its characters and actors.  (For example: when a character's knee is dislocated in a key scene, it STAYS dislocated, and said character is forced to hop around.  You just don't see that in a Schwarzenegger film.)  Tom Cruise is in fine form; he's still doing some of his own stunts, still kicking butt and taking names, and yes, he's still charming as all get out.  Joining him are Simon Pegg (returning from the previous film, with a much larger role), Paula Patton, and Jeremy Renner; each of these supporting characters/actors manages to hold their own and leave their stamp on the film, which isn't easy when you're acting opposite Tom Cruise.  For a villain, we have Michael Nyqvist (from the original GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO films), who doesn't get much to do, save for his final, brilliant, and heart-stopping scene.  There are also a few great cameos, which I won't spoil here; I'll only mention Tom Wilkinson because he was in the trailers, and because it's not easy to upstage Cruise and Renner, yet Wilkinson does so without breaking a sweat.MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL is a slick action movie, another solid entry in a deservedly-beloved series.  It isn't as great as the first film, and lacks the adrenaline-fueled rush of the third (not to mention Philip Seymour Hoffman), but it's still a fine flick, much better than it could have been (and what many people expected).  Maybe it's not perfect, but it doesn't try to be.  It's popcorn entertainment, brought to you courtesy of the powerhouse that is (and will always be) Tom Cruise.

I've now come to realize why Jason Bateman did not make it after Teen Wolf 2: he only has one character in him and he does it in every movie. Poor guy has not made a great movie yet. He works as the central character in Arrested Development because of the enormous talent surrounding him and the great writing. The guy from IASIP is just annoying. Anniston's character does not exist in real life, she is purely wish fulfillment. The three central men are portrayed as smart guys and then we are supposed to believe that all three of them will mess up their caper at every chance. They do nothing right, very predictably. Colin Farrell is fun, but only because it's him, like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. Steve Buscemi would have been better in both roles, but we would have just believed him and not thought it funny to have a Hollywood heart-throb play a douchebag. Is it funny to see a \"stud\" play a prick with a comb-over? Maybe for the first five seconds. The best moments are played by Jamie Foxx, as well as the way too short appearance by the guy from the Fantastic Four. Overall, the plot is obvious, the comedy is clunky, we don't get to know any of the characters at all (well, maybe Kevin Spacey's the most).", "qas": [{"question": "Is th plot of this film interesting?", "id": "98dc69e871080a0f13044411658e9a98", "answers": [{"text": "It has a few moments", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "the plot is obvious", "answer_start": 1328}]}]}]}, {"title": "B004G6009K", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Pros: 1.

Still, this movie has such an interesting premise, that I wanted to spend some \"time\" sharing my thoughts about it.  I'm a huge Matt Bomer fan (\"White Collar\"), and to a lesser extent, Cillian Murphy fan.  Cillian Murphy, the Timekeeper, plays a dynamic role.  You get that he can't resolve the inconsistencies of the system that he has spent the last 50 years of his life maintaining, yet like Mr. Stevens, the butler in Remains of the Days, you can tell that he has moments of real doubt whether he has wasted his life in his particular form of servitude. Yet he cannot fully admit to himself that he misspent his life, nitpicking the seconds and minutes of the poor and disenfranchised, while the wealthy can afford to loiter indefinitely. The Timekeeper has the integrity to not be paid off by billionyear, Mr. Weis, yet the Timekeeper still cannot fathom another way around the current status quo.  He is nonplussed when Will gives him enough time to spare his life.It was refreshing that the ghetto wasn't racially or ethnically segregated, just financially segregated.  A blonde-haired man with a posh British accent was the most menacing gangster in this \"wrong-side-of-the-toll\" Time Zone.I suppose in heaven we'll never age beyond late young adulthood, but in the here and now, it would be very strange to see different generations looking exactly the same age; therefore, no visibly aging actor was featured in this movie.  I haven't seen \"Logan's Run,\" but that movie apparently has a similar theme.This movie doesn't really offer solutions, but rather points out how problematic it is for the few privileged to live at the expense of the many underprivileged. This excessive wealth and out-of-proportion longevity doesn't even really make these privileged few happy, as Matt Bomer's character, Henry Hamilton, attests before he times out. If we could all live agelessly, there would be issues of scant resources and overpopulation, yet as I chronically pester my Facebook friends, if we all went whole foods-based vegan, that could help prevent and reverse human starvation, as imported grain (now being forced fed to animals) could be redistributed to humans (i.e., a higher quality version, along with dried beans), and animals can graze on indigestible-to-humans grass, including grass clippings during the winter. (I only recently learned that the meat industry is a huge contributor to human starvation; I went veg b/c I love animals and could no longer pretend it was okay to love my companion pets while hypocritically eating meat from animals who likewise have feelings and are sentient.)

The acting is brilliant at times (others it is as if they're saying, \"okay, I just closed this door - next scene!\"), the scenery is lush, the score is quiet nice. But, hands down, it definitely gets my vote for the WORST adapatation of Jane Eyre imaginable.  Aside from the brilliance of the actors (which is why I increased the rating to a two-star instead of one), there is very, very little in this movie that actually flows like the book.  However, I digress.  One of the worst parts of this movie is when Jane hears Rochester calling her. This movie has St. John and Jane outside and he's yelling at her.  As she turns to go up through the weeds, St. John yells as asks her why she's talking to the wind.  You scarcely hear Rochester at all.  Now, for those of you who don't realize this, Ms. Bronte was a Christian and a pastor's daughter.  Thus, this book definitely has instances in it that if you really are not following the Lord, you're not going to understand it completely.  The part in which Rochester is calling Jane when they're so far apart, actually happened to Ms. Bronte (check that out in her biography).  Again, God does things like that in our lives from time-to-time so well, someone trying to interpret that in a movie that isn't a Christian, well, then, it's like trying to read someone else's mail and making sense of it.  You just can't. Read Ms. Bronte's biography and you'll understand my next statement: I honestly think that Ms. Bronte would scream if she saw this movie!As a romance, the most romantic part of that book, in my opinion, is when Jane goes out to meet Rochester after Bertha rips her wedding veil.  It's pouring down rain, miserable, nighttime and windy.  In this movie, it's broad daylight and very sunny.  Instead of pulling Jane up on the horse with him, she just puts her head on his leg while he's sitting on the horse!  We won't even talk about all the dialogue liberties that were taken, the change of the storyline, just about anything you can think about happened in this movie.  It's just so choppy and doesn't make much sense, really.  The casting of Mia I thought was great - she even resembles Ms. Bronte, and Michael Fassbender was another good choice.Okay, I saved the best for last.  When Jane leaves Thornfield after the failed marriage, instead of having her sneak out while everyone is still sleeping, having her grab a piece of bread on the way out, they have Jane JUMPING OUT OF HER BEDROOM WINDOW!  You even get to see her land on the ground after falling from a second story window!  And, if you listen in the beginning of the movie, her room is in the back of the house.  Why now, all of a sudden, has her room changed and she's in the front going to the road?  SO WEIRD!Anyway, grab the book, just read it and forget about the movie portion.  There really isn't a good one out there that actually has been able to truly capture the heart of this book and it's characters and overall moral story.

Additionally Gollum once again remains the best bit of CGI in this series, even better than Smaug to be perfectly honest, with the performance behind him you can actually believe he's real for a few moments.2) The Misty Mountains song: this was almost perfectly executed and it really set up the culture of the dwarves and the fact that, though they may seem silly, they are the diaspora of the dwarves and are without a home.3) Christopher Lee's performance; this was one of the top things for me just because of how obvious it was that the poor man was in extreme pain, his straight back just showed and arthritic performance that sadly has to be the final film of an incredible career.4) Galadriel; somehow this film did not ruin Galadriel, Cate is actually more stunning here than in the first film and it is spectacular.Now for the more fun part, what I hated or disliked about this film1) The opening, I found this too similar to the opening in LoTR, though it gets a bit sillier in some respects, I was able to actually buy most of what was happening, and then a dwarf picks up a molten piece of metal with his bare hand and smashes it between two comically large hammers. This is problematic because it's silly and detracts from any realism that may have been built up in the opening.2)  The revealing of the Silmaril in the extended opening. This hurt me, this is something that should not be around, the silmarils are lost and that the dwarves somehow have one goes against so much of Tolkein's lore.3) Frodo's presence: I get it, we want to connect the two films but that this film is apparently just Bilbo writing of it is silly. I fully expect a scene in the third film where Frodo walks up, looks over Bilbo's shoulder and says &#34;Oh Bilbo, that's not how it happened.&#34;4) Azog the orc: listen to me. This orc should be dead, he died at Moria, it's his son that is following the party. I actually think that that would have made for a better story, maybe we see a different side of orc culture and we see an orc out for revenge for the death of his father, maybe make us actually relate to him for a second? A relatable villain, isn't that what we always want these days?5) Radagast the Narnian, suddenly this movie took a strange turn in which we're treated to goofy hedgehogs being protected by the Doctor (who is apparently high on Mushrooms) This was such a stupid interpretation of Radagast and it is an insult to everything the first films did as well as what Tolkien did. They wanted a character that appealed to the kiddies but if you have to do that by making him high I'm not sure if that actually is a good call.6) Gandalf's fear/irritation of Saruman: look at Fellowship. Look at Gandalf's and Saruman's relationship there, they are friends. Gandalf goes to Saruman and is clearly close with him, yet here we see Gandalf scared or annoyed of him. This is backsliding of characters and actually damages their relationship that was set up a decade ago.7) The line &#34;the legends are true! Giants! Stone Giants!&#34; This was so poorly delivered that it actually made the scene just seem like it was set up to show some rock 'em sock 'em robot fights. This scene would have been just as well executed if they never made mention of what they were but instead just had the battle and had the dwarves trying to survive.8) The Goblin King as presented in the extended edition: this character wasn't bad in the theatrical film, a little annoying and a little cartoony but still kind of fun and reminiscent of the book. In the extended edition though we are treated to a song (which I don't hate) which is ended by a fist pump (which is the worst). We are then treated to a &#34;made in Rivendale&#34; gag that is simply stupid and pulls you out of the film. These films should never make references to modern things and yet here we have a moment when the Goblin King essentially looks at the camera and winks, it detracts from the film and instead reminds you that you are in fact watching a film made &#34;for children&#34;9) Goblins/orcs: this is a nerdy one. Goblins and orcs are the same thing. Tolkien described the use of goblins as being a Hobbit language thing. Orcs is what men call them, there shouldn't be a difference between the two, especially in how they refer to themselves. I don't care if they look different but the language/names should be the same.10) The CGI chase scene through Goblin Town: This scene was stupid, we're treated to CGI characters running from CGI monsters that looks like a deleted scene from a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. This is followed by Gandalf facing down the Goblin King on a narrow bridge (like the Balrog, get it?) The bride breaks and they fall, this is stupid and shows the utter disregard for physics or survivability. The dwarves though land at the bottom safely, even after the Goblin King lands atop them.11) The overuse of CGI: This is the same issue I had with the second film. Jackson has lost himself, there was a time he would have done as much as possible with real effects, here though he seems to want to do as much with CGI as possible, even when the CGI looks awful. The wargs, the orcs, the goblins, the eagles, they all look terrible and only serve to pull any sense of realism from the film. Why is it that a film that came out a decade after LoTR and with a budget three times that of LoTR has CGI that looks worse than LoTR? I've seen what WETA can do. I've seen King Kong, I've seen District 9. For some reason this film's CGI looks awful, where did the money go? Did they have to rush the film? There's one interview that sticks in my mind on the extended edition. Jackson has a set of costumes made for the goblins that take the dwarves, however he soon decides he doesn't like them and instead converts them to CGI. I don't understand this mindset. Look at LoTR, despite the fact that almost all the orcs are costumes they look amazing. Jackson seems to have come to the conclusion that he can simply do it in CGI and call it good.Ultimately this is the first sign of what is wrong with the second film. Jackson is turning into George Lucas and is making the same mistakes he made with the prequel films (only with someone else's material, which is worse). I'm saddened by this, Jackson had so much potential but because of his sudden obsession with CGI and with getting these films done quickly has made it so what made the first films so good has been lost. Here we see a movie that is made for money alone. There is no real heart or passion in this film, it's apparent that few members of the cast have read the original material and it is apparent that Jackson has somehow been surrounded by yes men who won't question his decisions, even when they are terrible. I don't wand this to be the case but ultimately it is.This film is better than the second but that doesn't mean it's good. I am waiting for the end of this year just so we can see the end of this trilogy and we can let it fade into memory.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the comparison?", "id": "08135025f6a23f4684d1e3abe5b2f082", "answers": []}, {"question": "What's the unnecessary scene?", "id": "1f21bbd6917416c2366613b494f2bff5", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "First I'll say that I am a fan of all of Jackson's Middle Earth movies and have seen them all multiple times.

The added scenes to the film are great, you get to see some more of the shire and the most important added scene, in my opinion, is the extension of the Dale scene. You get to see the fight between Smaug and the people of Dale, which is shown more in the latest Hobbit film. The added scenes helps the continuity between this film and the Desolation of Smaug, by showing the black arrows and the white stones that are mentioned by the Elf King. The Purist will call this Blasphemy, but the Hobbit films create a better continuity to the Lord of the Rings films than the Hobbit does to the Lord of the Rings.The extended edition is worth buying and the extras are great to watch.

It was a pretty good film, however it didn't have the luster that Lord of The Rings had. The trilogy was magical, it's the reason people go to the movies, but the Hobbit, seemed to be playing off the fame of the Lord of The Rings and at times was directionless. For those who don't know the story, it starts to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins and his original journey with Gandalf. In the Lord of The Rings, they go on this impossible journey in order to save Middle Earth, but here, the journey is about saving the dwarfs gold from a dragon. It really doesn't have the intensity or the urgency require to make a film like this work. Nothing had changed for over two hundred years, but all of a sudden, now is the time to stop the dragon, why? The film was not bad, but it doesn't come off as this great adventure and that could have something to do with the childish elements. This is a PG-13 film with fighting and beheadings, yet it's also a film with singing dwarfs, drunk gnomes, and a wizard with Alzheimer who is covered in bird s***. I feel these things really hurt the film. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and finally seemed to be showing his age. McKellen is tired and slow in this film, Gandalf is not the same great warrior. Finally, this film is different because we know it's a prequel. Even if you didn't read the book, you know who lives and who dies, taking a major play away from the screenwriters. Overall the Hobbit is somewhat entertaining, but it's not The Lord of The Rings. It's directionless at times, lacks the urgency needed for an epic, and has a cast that really doesn't excite. I was hoping for a lot, but all I got was a little. The only thing I can do now is try and forget about it as I wait for the next film with anticipation.", "qas": [{"question": "How is film?", "id": "51bc202dc0deab0c8e4bdbefbf4041fd", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This is fun for any LotR fan, and the added scenes are fun.

My prophecies generally all came true. Some features were good, some were bad, some are arguable, depending upon what one values in a film.DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This movie is a fantasy-adventure, but not animated. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of The Shire, is recruited by Gandalf the Wizard to serve a dozen dwarfs as a \"burglar\" that they might journey to their former homeland on a great quest to reclaim the region as well as all the treasure which was seized by Smaug the Dragon. If you wish to see the ultimate battle, you'll have to stand by for about two years as this is only the first entry of two more films to come.The screenplay was extracted from J.R.R. Tolkien's fairy tale,*The Hobbit* which was initially published to massive popularity in 1937. Tolkien went on to publish *The Lord of the Rings*, (which was released as a trilogy in 1954-55), which picked up the Hobbit tale, (with a notably darker ambiance), and continued the story of Middle Earth.EVALUATIVE SUMMARY: One of the foremost failings with having the top people writing a screenplay, (in this case it was chiefly Director Sir Peter Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and family friend Philippa Boyens), is that there remains no objective person to influentially criticize the finished product. Even when others might offer useful and compelling opinions, the thoughts of these top people will always prevail. As a result, some nuances of this film do not benefit the overall work, (and in fact diminish it in terms of art), and this fact becomes blatantly evident to anyone who has considerable life experience with the foibles of people and their predictable behaviors.To be specific, the gifted Director Peter Jackson, teaming with the generally odious Hollywood moguls, clearly leaned much more heavily upon the profit-motivation aspect of this film, showing copiously less concern for the artfulness of the production which we witnessed with the earlier three *The Lord of the Rings* films. Up until the final moments, there were to be only TWO Hobbit films, (which was already twice the length required from my view.) That was apparently when the actuality hit them that they had inadvertently generated enough footage to stretch the financial proceeds even further by contriving *three* epic-length films and thus the dreaded announcement was issued with joyous enthusiasm.Here are the points which I find particularly objectionable regarding this film, (and no doubt to some unknown degree in the two anticipated films.)1. *The Hobbit* does not limit itself to the expected periodic comic relief - specifically, it bulges with low-brow one-liners and *The Three Stooges* -type slapstick undergraduate humor which the typical non-thinker savors so much these days. Most of these dubious witticisms manifest the additional flaw of being anachronistic in nature, detracting mightily from the script.2. The special effects, while quite professionally crafted, are unreservedly over-the-top and, at least for my tastes, reek of the diminutive Hollywood mentality. To put it bluntly, I seriously doubt that Professor Tolkien would have approved and I'll wager that even Peter Jackson, his eye on the paycheck, felt pangs of guilt.3. The inspired composer, Howard Shore, accepted a milk run on this one. Peter Jackson nearly annihilated him with unrelenting deadlines during the previous trilogy. I think Mr. Shore wised up in this instance and considered, \"People are going to make a *lot* of money on this film, people who will not be working their guts out as I did the last time around - so I'm not going to do it this time.\" And he didn't. One could hardly blame him. Goodwill can only be stretched so far. Most of the music here is recycled work from the previous trilogy. Yes, I understand the need to link the films, leitmotifs, etc., but so much of the film-score is precisely the same product, note for note, and could have been manipulated just a little.4. As it was clearly going to be necessary to stretch this tiny fairy tale in order to achieve three epic-length films, the movie integrates a glut of Hollywood fluff, (likely brain-gas hatched from Boyens' head, a person who could rationalize the activities of Pol Pot), the misdeed having been perpetrated on quite a monumental scale. The writers inserted a dark underlying scheme, for example, which supports the prelude to Sauron of the previous trilogy. This theme gave rise to all manner of opportunities which simply do not appear in the source work. As for the exploitation of dramatic license in re-working how certain events of the original book actually transpired, some of these scenes were well-done and some are entirely tasteless. Any thinking person can instantly determine which are which.Lesser misadventures with this film are equally evident but, in the interest of brevity, not worth enumerating.Overall, I was entertained by the film and it was certainly worth the nineteen bucks I paid for it at Wal-Mart. I thought that Sylvester McCoy's performance as Radagast the Brown was terrific. The former *Doctor Who* outshone most of the others. I do feel compelled to note that Cate Blanchette's work was something short of mediocre but, if she failed, most of the blame falls upon the writers. She's no longer stunning enough to simply stand around and look like a fairy princess which is what appears to have been attempted. Martin Freeman's performance as Bilbo Baggins was magnificent. His appearance, in regard to linking up with that of Ian Holm who plays the older Bilbo, was nothing short of sterling. So, Kudos to Peter Jackson on the overall casting.As I anticipated, the New Zealand landscapes were nothing short of astonishing and they added a remarkable ambiance to the movie. Peter Jackson demonstrates an imaginative eye for using just the right location for a shot. The costumes and make-up were pretty good, perhaps appearing just a bit dreadfully outlandish in the case of the dwarves. Richard Armitage, who plays Thorin Oakenshield doesn't look like a dwarf in any sense which is equally true of a couple of the younger dwarfs, Fili (Dean O'Gorman) and Kili (Aidan Turner); however, I did not view these three caveats as taking away from the film in any sense as their acting was largely first-rate, after accounting for dull-witted screenwriting.I don't wish to belabor any of the points I have introduced here. Some, (chiefly the young who attend the cinema with frequency), will see them quite differently. I come from a classic film and classic literature background so that is the basis for my views.A quick word on the second disc: You'll get two things, including the nine \"how we did it\" clips [blogs] which you can already watch for free on You Tube and, a somewhat commercial travelogue of New Zealand that only tenuously links to the making of the film. It's more of a tourism promotion but still informative and well-done. Somehow, one also gets an upload of the film to one's computer by entering a code which comes with the DVD. I don't know how to do this and will not bother but others might enjoy this feature.In summary, the movie is much darker and considerably more oriented toward adult views than the material of the original book, which was written for children. *The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey* is a fun and entertaining movie; however, it will definitely not withstand the test of time as will *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy of films which were all exponentially superior to this Peter Jackson entry.Highly recommended.", "qas": [{"question": "Do you like cinematography?", "id": "44e0a9484a2f472cc35888401ec8ade7", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "UPDATE (4/24/2013): This blu-ray disc does NOT contain a digital copy. It contains an Ultraviolet version, which means a copy streamed from the internet and frankly a less convenient and popular way to watch digital movies. So, don't buy this expecting to be able to get a digital copy for your iTunes account.First, a disclaimer:I saw this movie in 3D in 48 frames per second. I had wanted to see it in non-3D at the regular 24 fps, but the tickets for that show were already sold out (even though the one I saw started a half hour earlier - I guess everybody else wanted to see the regular version too). In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).With that said, here are some of my thoughts:STORY/BOOK ADAPTATIONI'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb, with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.***END SPOILER ALERT***As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.CHARACTERS/ACTINGI generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the \"Took\" (adventurous) and \"Baggins\" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.SPECIAL EFFECTSGenerally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.OVERALLThe Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor.", "qas": [{"question": "How much fun will I have?", "id": "c2422d537705d27473ed7e8388f53322", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Ever since \"The Lord of the Rings\" ended, fans have been clamoring for \"The Hobbit\" to be adapted as well.Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\" the first part of a trilogy of \"Hobbit\" movies. It has some few flaws (enough with the comedy!), but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.It took me two viewings of \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd. The second time, I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of \"The Hobbit\" (plus chunks of \"Unfinished Tales\") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast.As for the extended special edition, this only has twelve minutes of new footage -- and since it was a long movie from a duology-turned-trilogy, that isn't surprising. But it will have the vast wealth of extras that we've come to expect from Peter Jackson: \"The Appendices,\" a massive documentary that explores the entire filming of the movie. NINE HOURS OF EXTRAS, including audio commentary from Jackson and Phillipa Boyens.The comedy can be a bit grating, but \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey.

Almost 3 hours is ridiculous and pretentious. This isn't an assignment, there was no need or requirement to make this 3 hours long, especially when there was no point to doing so. I think it was much better than the past Lord of the Ring movies, but at a certain point, you could tell that all the actors were exhausted and the movie began to lose focus. If I had one wish, it would be for the next movies to come in under 2 hours long. Almost 3 hours without a point is just pushing it. The LOTR movies suffer from the same problem as the Harry Potter films. There is absolutely no point to making them ridiculously long. The audience doesn't benefit, it is more work for the film makers, and theaters can't turn over showings as often. Furthermore, casual fans will simply not bother. A great movie with a great plot can be 3 hours long. This shouldn't be. It has no business being so. In the editing process, a director should see that a film is dragging and start cutting scenes. Peter Jackson is NOT a bad film maker. I've seen his other films, which were fantastic. I have no idea why with LOTR, he is fixated with lengthening the time out?Hopefully, this will change after the somewhat lackluster reviews of the last film, but it's doubtful.

NOT do you agree?\" losers!SPOILERS WARNINGIt's such a shame that \"The Hobbit\" ended up being a drawn-out, bloated, boring mess that lacks compelling characters and an engaging story. This film is a complete and utter travesty. I had a really bad feeling about this movie when i saw the trailer, even though i loved the LOTR. When i saw the trailer i feared that the film makers and studio were milking this franchise by turning The Hobbit into a trilogy and that the final products would be filled with TOO MUCH FILLER and that it would ruin the movie.Sorry to say people, i was right....The first half of this film feels like a collage of deleted scenes that should have stayed deleted or waited until the extended cut dvd.I usually hate those people that text during films but my God, was i happy to have my cell phone during that first horrible, boring, monotonous first hour. THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THIS FILM 3 HOURS!!!!! The studio is just trying to make a buck and as a result the integrity of the film suffers. There's too much filler in this film...too much \"easter eggs\" that remind you of how great LOTR were.They might as well run a text prompt on the bottom of the screen like the news channels saying:\"Remember LOTR? that was so great. We're trying to recreate the same feeling again, so we will be making lots of meaningless references to those films throughout that have nothing to do with advancing the plot for this movie. Hey, that dwarf king dude is kinda like Aragon, huh? Hey look, it's Galadriel and Elrond. Doesn't this scene feel like the one from Fellowship of the Ring, when Galadriel gave Frodo the gifts and elf bread? REMEMBER LOTR?! THIS FILM IS PART OF THAT UNIVERSE!!!THIS FILM IS PART OF THAT UNIVERSE!!!THIS FILM IS PART OF THAT UNIVERSE!!! ISN'T IT SO COOL. THAT MAKES THIS FILM A MASTERPIECE OUT THE BOX!SO GIVE US YOUR MONEY AND BUY ALL THINGS HOBBIT! AND DISLIKE ALL CUSTOMER REVIEWS THAT DON'T AGREE US....repeat prompt\"The first half of the film is so boring that by the time they go on the adventure..i forgot why the hell their even setting out on this journey...and i've read the book!\"Why the hell are these dwarf idiots so important and why are we going on this journey? OH YEAH! BECAUSE OF THE DRAGON AND THEIR GOLD\" I had this thought like 3 times during the screening.Each LOTR film can stand on it's own but not this boring piece of crap. And it has nothing to do with the Hobbit book, which i love. This film should have been one 3 and half hour epic film, not 3 films. It's ridiculous!! People talk down a lot about the Star Wars prequels but I'd watch Phantom Menace any day over this horrid piece of boring junk.The Hobbit is 287 pages. So it;'s completely idiotic and  pure greed for money that they made this into 3, 3 hour films. In the book, the Dwarves have left Bilbo's and Bilbo runs out on his adventure in 17 pages. Peter Jackson takes a HOUR to get the journey started with a whole half hour of \"put that down, don't break that, leave that alone, will you stop, no you can't do that, what are you doing, please stop!\"STOP, PLEASE! WE GET IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The dwarfs are unwanted by Bilbo, stop hitting it over the head just to fill up time!The bizarre, unfunny, slapstick humor is painful. This involves snot jokes, burping, poop hair, and lame one-liners. Don't give me the \"it's based on a children's book\" crap. Sure, the source material was written for children but I'm talking about the movie. Adding all this stupid humor really messes with the tone; it doesn't feel like it belongs in the LOTR universe which \"The Hobbit\" is trying so hard replicate. The film will go from trying to be epic to pathetic gags. It doesn't work. I don't mind a little humor occasionally but this is just overdone and it makes the film feel very unbalanced.Radagast's involvement is pointless and his bunny sled is ridiculous. We also get to see Saruman and Galadriel in a boring scene that has absolutely no relevance to the main narrative. Wait, what exactly is \"The Hobbit\" about again? Apparently Jackson is trying to make connections with LOTR, but \"Fellowship of the Ring\" already explains past events pretty well. Seriously, all the LOTR fanboy pleasing scenes could have been left out (including Frodo). But no, we need them in order to have enough material for the trilogy. Not good.And I understand that Jackson is taking material from the appendices of LOTR. I wouldn't have a problem with this if all these extra scenes actually advanced the plot. But the White Council just talks and they never decide to act on anything. Also, that scene has NOTHING to do with the dwarves reclaiming their homeland. At least in \"Fellowship\" the plot makes major advancements but in \"The Hobbit\" the story hardly goes anywhere. BORING!For the first 20 minutes we get all this old Bilbo recollecting his adventures and seeing Elijah Wood and all these unnecessary references to LOTR just to buy time to make this 3 hours. They try too hard to tie this film into LOTR, just in hope that some of its greatness will rub off.The first 10 minutes of the film goes like this: T...  H...  E...The next 10 go like this: H...o...b...The next 10 go like this b....i....t...30 minutes just for the titles!!!The next half hour is Bilbo picking up a pencil.....THEN IT TAKES ANOTHER 30 MINUTES JUST FOR HIM TO WRITE \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit....\" THE FIRST WORDS IN THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Greed for cash ruined this story. Period. I won't even bother to see the next two. And like an idiot I gave away the 1977 animated film because I THOUGHT for sure this would blow that away. Boy, was I wrong. Time to place my Amazon order for that again...I will admit that the scenes with Golumn and the Goblin King were great but scenes don't make a good movie", "qas": [{"question": "Does Mila Jovovich have many lines?", "id": "b43bfb08f3db8d3286ac5d3359f04d74", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The Hobbit has been on the minds of fans ever since we heard The Lord of the Rings would be made into films first. It's actually a very ambitious story to translate to film when you consider the book's intended demographic of children; whereas The Lord of the Rings was definitively a story for adults. However, director Peter Jackson seems to have a very clear idea of how to balance The Hobbit.The Hobbit seemed like a long time coming but it was well worth the wait. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is long. However it doesn't seem bloated. Despite a slower pace than the LOTR trilogy, it feels calmer and more deliberate. Utilizing an expanded story thanks to the Appendices, Unfinished Tales and Silmarillion, the characters and story feel more flushed out and not rushed. Yes there are changes from the book, (introducing an enemy for Thorin), but they don't ruin the movie. The pacing is refreshing. It gives the audience adequate breathing room between our action sequences and story development. While some may find the scenes with Radagast and Rivendell overly long, they actually work to successfully bridge The Hobbit to The Fellowship of the Ring just as intended. Whatever complaints I may have about the film are minimal when shown against the ultimate canvas of the finished product.The film is also wonderfully acted - particularly by Martin Freeman (Bilbo). It's whimsical, lighthearted and relaxed. It still has the emotional impact and tension at the right moments, something Jackson has gotten better at in each film. As expected, Sir Ian McKellan also gives a great performance as Gandalf the Grey. The mysterious yet playful Gandalf from The Fellowship of the Ring is back, but as equally suspicious of the growing doom of Middle-Earth. Additionally, the Riddles in the Dark scene was perfect and absolutely how I imagined it as a kid when I read the book. Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Freeman have wonderful chemistry and it provides another layer to the complexity of Gollum/ Smeagol.As for the High Frame Rate and visual aspect of the film, it's remarkable. At first it is a bit jarring. It seems almost too real and in that sense fake, but you then lose yourself and remember that life in fact actually looks like that! The Hobbit is crisp, bright and clean. Yes, there are times that the CGI seems a bit fake, but when the rest of the film is as beautiful, you don't give it a second notice. The 3D is used to expand the film visually and very rarely for sight gag and thanks to HFR is smooth and you forget it actually is 3D. It was an immense joy to watch. The scenery is beautiful and breathtaking. Echoing the travel scenes from Fellowship, The Hobbit also gives us glorious wide shots of the early journey and the HFR and 3D give it unimaginable scope.The film seems inevitable to divide people on the HFR vs standard 24 frames/ second, but Jackson may indeed have begun the change to a new cinema experience. Change is unsettling and people are inherently resistant to it, but when its all said and done, this is absolutely a film to see in the theaters; and more importantly one to be seen in HFR if you're lucky enough to have a theater projecting it in that format as Jackson intended it to be seen.Verdict: See In Theaters![...]", "qas": [{"question": "Which film is better?", "id": "d511ca7f92053424565ae7f3c577f5bf", "answers": [{"text": "The Hobbit", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, {"context": "Being my favorite book I had to see this in theatres, and I finally have.

No fantasy or epic film can match The Lord of the Rings trilogy, being perfect for a film and its deliverance (even if there are differences between it and the books). Middle Earth was created for us, it felt real, and still does when seeing the films. Now, there are other tales in the world of Lord of the Rings, and they've finally brought to the big screen The Hobbit, the prequel to The Lord of the Rings. Now, if anyone other than Peter Jackson was attached to The Hobbit, it would have failed on every level, as Peter Jackson is the only one who can truly take us into that fantastical world, along with the original crew of producers, writers and the composer (Howard Shore). Now, when it comes to The Hobbit, things are different from The Lord of the Rings. Now some people say that The Hobbit was a little too slow in the beginning, but if you compare the beginning to Fellowship of the Ring, they are the exact same pacing. The script is gold, being filled with funny quips, intense fright, and epic battle sequences. The acting was top-notch, especially when it came to Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the Company of Dwarves. Peter Jackson took the character (to those who've read the book, know he was more of a jerk) and made him a likeable warrior who is haunted by his past, by not being able to save Erebor, or so it seems. Peter Jackson is perfect once again, going back to the world that was pictured for us, and brings it back to life. The visual effects were great, but not as spectacular and \"real\" as Prometheus. The music was superb, being the classic Lord of the Rings, while adding a new theme from the \"Misty Mountains\". Now i do agree that making The Hobbit into a trilogy may stretch it thin, but from how An Unexpected Journey turned out, i'm starting to root for more because this place that Peter Jackson has brought to us can only be seen through J.R.R. Tolkien's writing, our imagination, or through the exceptional adaptation that Jackson has done. On par with Fellowship, for kick-starting a new journey that is neither darker, funnier, or lesser in any way.Overall, The Hobbit is a must-see for everyone who appreciates film, likes/loves Lord of the Rings and fantasy, and anyone who enjoys a great ride into imagination.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the depth?", "id": "666e1a273d2a8e3312447d5aa432adef", "answers": [{"text": "The script is gold", "answer_start": 1050}]}]}, {"context": "Overall I liked this movie.

And I don't mean to bore you with details, so I won't.  But there's a lot of ground to cover.First, some context.  Believe it or not, I never read or was read \"The Hobbit\", though I own it on audiobook (but I keep falling asleep while it's playing).  I also never bothered to watch any of the \"Star Wars\" movies (no, none of them).  Therefore, I have no comparison point to the book or Jar Jar Binks which everyone else seems to want to throw this under.  I did watch the extended editions of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, and I will do some comparatives there.For those that don't know the book, this has actually little to do with the book itself.  In fact, while it shares the name and the basic premise, there is a lot of fluff thrown in for 'good' measure.  It is important that you approach this movie the way I did: It is essentially a prologue to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a device to help explain what happened before the \"Fellowship of the Ring\".  While the book is supposed to be the same, there were a lot of missing elements in the story due to J.R. Tolkien not living long enough to get everything tied up.  His son tried, but this movie is really the first time we see the puzzle pieces fitting together.  The end result is rather confusing, so try best to follow along.The movie begins with a voiceover from Bilbo Baggins, who is writing what will eventually be \"There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale\", seen at the end of the \"Return of the King\".  What he is speaking is found in the letter that he has left for Frodo at the end of his adventure.  It then goes to the now infamous starting line from the book: \"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit...\" and the whole first few sentences.  It then goes to a brief conversation between Bilbo and Frodo (yes, Elijah Wood).  This culminates into a first meeting with Gandalf, and the dwarves who are embarking on an adventure.I had a number of problems with how this started.  It felt like Jackson was trying desperately to match what was said in the book - down to the corny diatribe from Gandalf to Bilbo - even though none of it matched the character.  Yet, the full duration of the movie is full with blatant attempts to be a prequel to \"Lord of the Rings\".  As such one would expect somewhat clear personality similarities, especially with Gandalf, that simply aren't there in the first parts of the movie.  Secondly, while I wasn't as upset with the dwarf-at-hobbit-hole scene as other reviewers, I had tons of questions.  Why are they not questioning their being sent there?  Why are they simply trusting of Gandalf that this hobbit is the right person?  And why was Bilbo so eager to join the squad?  Again, from what little I recall from the story, Bilbo is constantly reluctant to go on the adventure the entire time.  Yet in the movie this is brushed off as just a brief hesitation.Once the real adventure begins, the movie starts a sharp divergence from the story.  It still keeps certain elements but there are many others that were simply patched in from other Tolkien stories such as \"The Silmarillion\" and \"Unfinished Tales\".  For example, there isn't a serious session with Saruman and Galadriel with Agent Lord Elrond, with Saruman chewing Gandalf out for making the party (BTW, when Elrond said \"purpose\", he WAS Agent Smith.  Poor Hugo).  There's no epic battle with Albino orcs.  The list goes on and on, and clearly the intent is to maintain the same level of majesty found in the trilogy, so it's understandable why fans of the book might be miffed at some of what's thrown in, nevermind exposing certain characters that were never in \"The Hobbit\" to begin with (aka Frodo and others).The remainder of the movie is wrought with the same amount of orchestral marching scenes panning gorgeous landscapes in New Zealand as are found in the trilogy.  Thinking of this movie in a different angle, you might not expect this since the book itself is quite short and not the epic adventure that the movie portrays it to be; this is precisely why I say that you must set aside that expectation before approaching the movie.  Seen as simply a prequel to the trilogy, everything makes perfect sense and obviously that's how Jackson saw the endeavor.  He wasn't trying to turn the book literally into the movie (though the first 30 minutes would convince you otherwise).Much has been made of Radagast the Brown.  Turned from a couple of colorful sentences in the book to a larger-than-life character, Radagast's parts could easily have been excluded entirely.  He adds nothing to the story except finding a certain sword that is shown to Saruman (and thus dismissed as unverified).  I didn't have as much issue with how the character was presented with bird droppings in his beard and down the side of his face; indeed, most book-to-movie attempts result in the exact same (see \"A Wrinkle in Time\" by Disney as a perfect example).  As with the aforementioned, if the target is to appeal to the children that read the book rather than the child that is now an adult watching the movie, sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.Regarding the Blu-ray...my TV, an Insignia that I got about 3 years ago at a really good deal, has the ability to closely emulate the 48fps that the movie was presented at in theaters; just not in 3D (I hate 3D).  So I was able to experience the \"speed\" of things that people were talking about.  The best way I can describe it would be like a play, or a live action event where you are watching things right there on set while they're filming it. It didn't bug me too much since Back to the Future Blu-ray did the same thing at times, but where it got weird is any scene that was filmed with obvious fake props.  The most notable I saw was a scene where they panned over a landscape that was obviously not real; fake trees stuck into fake grass rather than a real area.  Also, when Gandalf is talking to Galadriel, the pillars to her left and right were too fake looking.  Gandalf himself, it was just seeing Ian McKellen in makeup all the time, unlike the trilogy where he blended into the character so well.  Overall, the quality was so clear and clean that you were easily able to see such imperfections and it took you out of the movie, combined with this new filming speed.If I had to name my biggest complaints, it would be the fight scenes; every last one of them.  They're all the same: party gets stuck into some sort of impossible situation with enemies twice or larger their size.  Even with so many dwarves they still manage to get beat down and either tied up, incapacitated, or stuck.  In every situation except one, Bilbo is the one that saves them.  This is stark opposite of the trilogy where Frodo didn't do hardly anything.  In fact Frodo was more of a coward than Bilbo in the movie even though the book has Bilbo being less willing to chip in and save the day.Then there is the introduction of Bilbo to Gollum.  A lot of people applaud this as the best scene in the movie, but frankly it was nothing special.  The Gollum character was played well, and the creepy mannerisms are something to behold, but the scene itself was quite unremarkable.Frankly, it was not a bad movie nor was it too long.  I didn't get the same sense of overall fulfillment from it that I got from Fellowship, nor did I gain much from the Bilbo character here.  Bilbo in the trilogy was a lot more entertaining overall, and \"The Hobbit\" at times felt mislabeled; as though it should have been called \"The Dwarven Quest\" because they dominated the screenplay almost exclusively.  This might have been in response to complaints about Frodo and Sam dominating the trilogy; I'm not sure.  In any case, as long as you don't bring book bias the movie is worth a watch.  But don't expect it to blow you away.  It's a decent movie, not a great one.If you buy the Blu-ray be sure to opt for the triple set with 3D Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD.  It was 2 bucks more than the non-3D version.  If you do get a 3D TV in the future then you'll already be set.  I wouldn't worry about the extended edition unless you're so fan clouded you must have it, but I felt the movie was quite long enough.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the video?", "id": "60368778a162154f01989a99ab005a29", "answers": [{"text": "As with the aforementioned", "answer_start": 4928}]}]}]}, {"title": "B0059XTUVI", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Reviews that have criticized The Iron Lady for being a muddled patchwork of segments in the political life of Margaret Thatcher, scenes that took place without a context, have missed the point of the film.

Well, all I can say is that this was a grand entertainment and I am so glad I caught it on the big screen!I've heard some critics say the plot was a mess and overly convoluted. Really?  My suggestion to them is \"don't text while watching a movie, you might miss something\".  I found the plot fairly well done and actually made sense (if only the last Star Trek film had that going for it) and was interesting to boot.I also read that the look of Barsoom (Mars to you and me) was dull and uninteresting.  Hmmm, never been an admirerer of the stark and raw beauty of the American southwest I guess.  Personally I found Barsoom to be beautiful, alien, exotic and familiar all at the same time. After all, the Mars rovers have confirmed that the Red Planet does indeed look like our American southwest and I for one happen to think both places very scenic.Some critics have said the story is dull and lifeless.  OK, put down the crack pipe and step away from the video game console.  \"John Carter\" has a great fast paced plot with lots of interesting twists and turns. I also thought the characters were nicely drawn, if not overly complex, and that the alien races on Barsoom to be very interesting with fascinating customs which only made me want to learn more about them.Other critics have complained that they have seen this stuff before in movies like Star Wars and Avatar.  Wellllll, it seems as though those two directors (among other film makers and writers) have been looting the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs for quite some time so I guess there is bound to be a feeling of deja vu.Have we really become such a culture that is so easily jaded?  Can we no longer feel that sense of wonder and feeling of adventure in a film like \"John Carter\"?  Maybe we are too use to storylines being spoon fed to us in easily digested bites and cannot follow along with a film that isn't zipping past our eyeballs at 186,000 miles per second with flashy explosions at every eye blink.

I did for example know what a Thark was going in. And having seen it I have to pay this film the highest compliment I can give: I want to read the books. I fear that a sequel will never be made, and while the film doesn't end on a cliffhanger per se it does feel rather like the ending of the Fellowship of the Ring. And that is sad because of all the movies out there getting sequels at the moment I can think of no world I'd rather go back to than this one.The world is the main selling point of this film. Mars (or Barsoom) is an ancient world, dry and dying. It is filled with beautiful red deserts (which I feel could have been a little more red but still...) and strange peoples. The strangest are probably the Tharks: nine-foot tall green aliens with big tusks and anger issues. They are led by Tars Tarkas, an excellent Willem Dafoe who apparently acted out the part on stilts. The Tharks are what the Na'vi should have been. They may have some of the characteristics of the 'noble savage' but they are also violent and not particularly friendly to outsiders. In other words they have the capacity to be noble but they can also be a genuine threat.If I occasionally compare this film to Avatar or other films it is an unfortunate necessity. Many science fiction epics have stolen much from John Carter. This has led to many complaints of 'having seen it before' and 'it's ripping off other, better films.' Many of these critics don't realize that John Carter is the work that has been ripped off, not vice versa, and even for those who do it doesn't matter. They are film critics after all, not literary ones. The most obvious case of the movie 'ripping off' a 'better' movie is in the arena sequence. This looks exactly like the sequence from the end of Attack of the Clones. Even though it is done better and makes more sense here, I can't deny that it looks like a blatant rip off to those not in the know. But on the whole I was surprised how new and fresh it appears. The ships and costumes are amazing. They used an admirable amount of restraint in making them feel used and lived in. The motorbike-type ships offer the best example of this. The wings fold up and pop out only when in use. In every film I've seen for the last fifteen years the action of opening/closing the sails would be a big complicated affair to show off how cool the technology is. Here it simply pops open. It feels like a real piece of technology that one might use rather than a cheap gimmick. As to the costumes, they are uniformly excellent. They feel lived in, and if they are slightly campy they never go overboard.I'd call the story fairly basic, although there is much detail given along the way. There is an evil general called Sab Than who wants to take over Mars and so he wishes to marry princess Deja Thoris of his rival city. Pretty standard stuff, and he seems a thoughtless brute right out of Flash Gordon or some other adventure serial. Where things get interesting is in the people controlling him. For he is not the film's main villain, merely their puppet. The true villains of the piece are the Tharns, a race of immortals who can disguise their appearance at will and who feed off the destruction of worlds. They've given great power to Than since he seems most likely to achieve this end. He's a good choice too since he causes such a big commotion that people don't think to look beyond him for even darker motives. The really nice thing about the Tharns is that they aren't really brute force villains. They don't destroy the planets, they simply arrange for the inhabitants to do so. They are a quite genuine threat, and when they're done with Mars their next stop is Earth. I don't understand why that little fact has been left out of the trailers.It is through the Tharns that John Carter ends up on Mars. They have the ability to transport themselves between worlds and Carter ends up on Mars by accident after killing one. Here we get one of the film's few missteps. The scenes on Earth take up about twenty minutes and are not particularly engaging, despite Bryan Cranston as a Union officer trying to recruit Carter into the army for some undeveloped reason. Oh yeah, it's 1868 and John Carter is a Confederate veteran from Virginia. Kinda important to know that. Fortunately, once he gets to Mars there is rather more life in the film. John finds that he is insanely strong and has the ability to jump really high due to the lower gravity on Mars. Once there he ends up stuck in one bad situation after another as he acclimates himself to the world. Naturally it's not long before he runs into princess Deja who is fleeing her forced wedding.Character-wise Deja is the real standout. Many people have compared her to princess Leia, but while this comparison is not without merit she is very much her own character. She manages to come off as tough and noble without it feeling forced. I often find female action heroes to be lacking a certain credibility that the guys acquire more easily, yet in this case I found the girl more believable a fighter than the guy. Partly it comes down to the inconsistency of his superpoweredness, but there is also the fact that Taylor Kitsch just isn't a very good actor. He certainly doesn't ruin the film, but he doesn't particularly impress either. That's probably a good part of why the Earth scenes felt flat. They could have really used a better leading man in this role. Fortunately the supporting cast more than make up for it. As with most epic films of this sort the lead character is a somewhat blank slate simply to provide a focus of normality in the crazy world. I've mentioned most of the supporting cast already, but especial props must go out to Mark Strong and Willem Dafoe. Mark Strong is the lead Thern, and for a character who never emotes or acts even remotely menacing he manages to be quietly terrifying. But in some ways he has it easy since he is in an comparatively uncumbersome costume. Willem Dafoe was acting on stilts in the middle of the Arizona desert knowing all the while that he would be digitally replaced in post-production, yet his Tars truly feels like a living character. The other actors do their part well and while there is a fair amount of overacting there are no really bad performances here. Even Kitsch manages to be decent if unimpressive.The rest of the production is similarly first-rate. Effects, scripting, editing - all top class. The musical score is very nice, though they do tend to repeat just one theme instead of creating several. The action scenes have been criticized as sub-standard, but I don't see it. For me the key mark of a good action scene is that I actually care what happens in it. On that mark they certainly succeed. If they could have used more inventive plotting, well that's a fairly minor flaw. A more substantial problem which critics can't seem to get over is the nature of the world. People are flying around in airships powered by light, yet they're still fighting with swords. This is one of those things you can just either accept or not. I have no problem with suspending my disbelief, but I get that others can't. To which I simply have this to say: this movie isn't for you. This film is likely to have a fairly narrow audience, although I imagine it would be popular with the majority of kids. Those who can appreciate this kind of thing, and can ignore that it's set on Mars, are likely to find that it is amazingly good fun.I'm rather amazed that this film got made at all. it is not the sort of movie studio execs like to see. Aliens, a campy story (on Mars no less), and a rather eccentric group of characters, all with no big star. It's amazing it ever got funded. People seem uninterested in seeing it, which is very unfortunate as this is a film which deserves to succeed. I want to see more of the marvelous world of Barsoom and the further adventures of John Carter. But Disney seems uncertain of how to market this, as evidenced by the removal of the iconic \"From Mars\" from after John Carter's name. This is a film which you will either love or not. And there's nothing wrong with that. Some people love sushi, but I can't stand it. That doesn't mean that sushi is bad and everything I like good. The simplest way to figure out whether you will like this film is to ask yourself whether the idea of swordfights in airships and green aliens on Mars appeals to you. If it does then the odds are that you'll like this movie. If you're not sure, give it a shot. you may be surprised. But if that just sounds silly and ridiculous then avoid this movie. It is exactly what it appears to be: a scifi action-adventure with aliens, flying ships, and sword-fights.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the story?", "id": "af2108bd1a60968037ad664ac783d3e5", "answers": [{"text": "having", "answer_start": 22}, {"text": "I went into this film having never read the books", "answer_start": 0}]}]}, {"context": "An 1800's man finds himself on another planet, around alien beings.

This is how the story goes: In the year 1752, Joshua and Naomi Collins, with young son Barnabas, set sail from Liverpool, England to start a new life in America. But even an ocean was not enough to escape the mysterious curse that has plagued their family. Two decades pass and Barnabas has the world at his feet -- or at least the town of Collinsport, Maine. The master of Collinwood Manor, Barnabas is rich, powerful and an inveterate playboy...until he makes the grave mistake of breaking the heart of Angelique Bouchard. A witch, in every sense of the word, Angelique dooms him to a fate worse than death: turning him into a vampire, and then burying him alive.Two centuries later, Barnabas is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972. He returns to Collinwood Manor to find that his once-grand estate has fallen into ruin. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better, each harboring their own dark secrets. Matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard has called upon live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman, to help with her family troubles.Also residing in the manor is Elizabeth's ne'er-do-well brother, Roger Collins; her rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn Stoddard; and Roger's precocious 10-year-old son, David Collins.The cast led by Johnny Depp (as Barnabas, who also produced) & Michelle Pfeiffer (as Elizabeth) is great. The directing by Tim Burton is great.

As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas.

The film's opening shot traverses a stunning landscape until we reach the edge of a raging torrent of a river that plunges into a mammoth water fall. Here we see a hooded humanoid figure walk to the water's edge and consume the liquid contents of, what looks to be, a steel sphere-like object that obviously doesn't agree with the humanoid as we find out in spectacular fashion.Cut to the Outer Hebrides in 2089 as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), an archeologist, is hacking away at a mountainside and discovers a cave full of what appear to be ancient paintings depicting, amongst other things, a scene in which a very large figure is pointing to a constellation in the night sky. We then find out that very similar images have been found in various other places on the Earth all dating from its pre-history, which means, of course, that the artists could never have met and exchanged information. Shaw, and her boyfriend/collaborator, Dr. Charlie Holloway (the improbably named Logan Marshall-Green), convince Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce made up to look like a really old bloke who looks like Guy Pearce made up to look like a really old bloke), the decrepit head of the Weyland corporation, that they have discovered a race of beings, who we come to know later as the `Engineers', and it was they who created Homo Sapiens, us! Weyland, who appears to have at least 1.999 feet in the grave, is desperately keen to make contact with the engineers thinking that, if he can have a chat with his maker(s) he might achieve some form of immortality.Cut to a team meeting in the spacecraft Prometheus addressed by Weyland, Shaw and Holloway in which the team are apprised of their destination; the aforementioned constellation that comprises a star with a planet with an Earth-like satellite; the apparent `home' of the engineers. The team comprises the `usual (united nations) suspects'; a nerdy biologist, an anti-social, bordering on sociopathic, geologist played hammingly to the hilt by a typecast Sean Harris and various examples of grunt muscle sporting mammoth machine gun type weapons, etc. All of this is presided over by an ice queen bitch, Charlize Theron, who plays Meredith Vickers who, we subsequently learn, has her own very special reasons for being involved.The plus points are the look of the whole thing which has brilliant production design. The movie credits H. R. Giger, rightly, as it's look, once we've returned to the Engineer's ship, is heavily influenced by his original artwork.The score, by German composer, Marc Streitenfeld, is also moderately impressive and even manages to feature a smidgeon of the original Jerry Goldsmith score for Alien, but lacks the latter's lyrical beauty and its insidious power to get under the skin of the listener to convey convincingly the sheer otherworldliness of the alien landscape that the Nostromo's crew encounters.The performances are fine with Michael Fassbender's subtly invidious robot, David, and Idris Elba's ship's captain highlights (although why he has to be American is anyone's guess).However, there is virtually no originality on show anywhere: this is sheer derivation albeit, in places, self-derivation some examples of which are:Guy Pearce's Peter Weyland looks like 2001's elderly Dave Bowman; Peter Weyland's talk mirrors his relative/namesake, Charles Bishop Weyland's talk to his team in Alien vs Predator during which the same plot point re: the cave images is made; the Prometheus crew members' space suits look as if they have been directly `lifted' from the original Tron; the ground team attempt to make the same stupid mistake and bring a contaminated individual back into the ship; the robot, David, is the same amoral corporate toady as is Ash in Alien and Elizabeth Shaw, who appears to be an expert in everything (including making luxury chocolates?) initiates the feisty female role later reprised by the Nostromo's third officer, Ripley; Shaw is impregnated as is Ripley later at the end of Aliens; the seemingly natural mineral `covering' of the alien ship is revealed by the hurricane to have a statuesque Mount Rushmore type face sculpted into it very reminiscent of the Necromonger's gargantuan statuesque Mount Rushmore type weapon delivery system in the Chronicles of Riddick; Shaw reaches seeming sanctuary after a truly crappy day only to find an engineer and a giant alien hexapus on board; a similar scenario to that which Ripley will experience a few decades hence; the engineers appear to be albino versions of Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen, and so on and so on.Part of what made the original so compelling was the make-up of the crew; they were all believable and behaved in expected ways and, largely, went about their jobs with humour and sometimes, apart from allowing Kane back on board, grudging, efficiency. The crew members of the Prometheus are exactly the opposite: these people have been chosen by a corporation who can afford the best of the best in terms of intellect, knowledge, experience, skill, versatility, the ability to think strategically and above all, logically, and they pick these buffoons?  That is taking the suspension of disbelief too far!  Ridley, what in God&#8217;s name were you thinking?  These supreme ambassadors of the human race make very brainless decisions throughout; e.g. why would you snuggle up to a cute little alien when it could be a killing machine and harbour any number of pathogens unknown and lethal to human beings - and this from a biologist! And talking biology, how is it that the engineers have identical DNA to humans but look dramatically different; i.e. 8 feet albinos built like over-inflated Arnie balloons?

I think he would have gotten a real kick out of this movie.I truly expected this film to be terrible; after all, the premise is absolutely ridiculous. After a while, though, I found myself able to suspend disbelief and enjoy it. Why not a superhero President, after all? Especially the greatest of all our Presidents?Young Abraham Lincoln, rail-splitter, flatboatman, lawyer, and political aspirant, has a deep dark secret: He's a Fearless Vampire Hunter armed with a silver bladed axe which he handles like a nunchuk, and when he's not splitting rails he's splitting vampires, who seem to be a plague on the frontier.Actually, they're a plague everywhere, especially in the South, where they've set up their own secret Vampire Empire (Vempire?), feeding off the slave population for generations. Tired of living in the shadows, the vampire hordes decide to set up their own country, and Abe Lincoln must lead an army to conquer them before they destroy every mortal below the Mason-Dixon Line, ultimately moving North in search of victims. And mortals call it \"the Civil War.\"So, in sum, the film's message is that the Confederacy is a nation full of murderous bloodsuckers. It's an interesting twist on history (and the history in ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER is pretty twisted, so kids, don't do a book report on it), and, oddly enough for a film of this type, a direct political statement on human rights.It's very clear that this movie wouldn't do well on Stone Mountain, Georgia, but if you just like fast-moving action and good special effects, and excellent cinematography (the film has a definite tintype feel to it), then sit back and go for a wild ride.

But I sat down to watch it based on the idea of a main female protagonist and with a love of all things Scottish.  I was not disappointed.  The humor was great, if crude at times, and the Scots characters covered a spectrum as displayed by the different virtues and vices of each clan.Merida is a princess and is expected to wed one of the three sons of the other three clans.  Her own father is head of the fourth clan, and she discovers a clause so that she can \"fight\" for her own hand and takes part in the contests.  Of course, she is a wild girl who can ride, hunt, and shoot with the best and resents her much more dignified and formal mother's attempts to make a real \"lady\" out of her.  She resists what she sees as her Fate and so discovers that the question about Princess vs Rebel was never so far apart as she first thought.This is a real mother-daughter picture, one that brings the two together as they fight to overcome the results of a badly-chosen spell.  In-between the funny scenes, we see how they each learn to really see each other, rather than their expectations of each other.The movie has many elements (especially how people speak) woven into the (somewhat) more historical ones, so it will appeal to a modern audience.  Fortunately, it isn't too distracting.  There is enough action that most kids won't get too bored, but I would recommend this movie more for 8 year olds and up than any younger ones.

How true that statement is? It all comes down to your sense of humor I guess. Humor is subjective much like everything else but it does have some universal rules that gives it an objective view. So, if the masses thought that a specific film is funny then it should be. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with Ted or at least from my experience.I won't come here and say somethings like: \"this is the most terrible movie that I've ever seen, Just stay away from it.Oh My, the amount of racist, sexual inappropriate jokes is a turn off and everyone be as far as possible from this indecent and corrupted piece of disgusting photography that has a general outline also called as a movie for moral's sake and good old PG films\"Actually the sense of humor unlike many others who didn't enjoy this film is probably not the main reason I didn't like it. I'm used to Family Guy I won't say it's the best show on earth because I personally don't find it hilarious but it's watchable and sometimes though rarely funny. The so called Shocking content wasn't also why I give this film a 2 star I'm not a Prude by any means! Actually the more shocking and inappropriate the better. The Cast was good, the premise has been done before but not in a R rated form so that was kinda new. So What went wrong? I don't know I just think this movie is somehow lacking.I personally was hoping to laugh like there's no tomorrow, however that didn't happen some jokes were funny but the majority of the film wasn't which is somehow skipping the point of this story, I mean it is supposed to entertain and humor you through out right? versus a couple of scenes.It was really hard to feel sorry or sympathetic for Ted *the main character* because he wasn't likable at all. Not mainly because he smoke pot and bullsh*t a lot. But because he just wasn't. He was obnoxious, unbearable and totally without an agenda for the future, he was just like a Paris Hilton bear version those people who do nothing all day, and just party all long and then do it all again, while the rest of the population is working their heads off for financial security. How can anyone like these people seriously?I think the character of Ted is quite two dimensional which is bad, because it had the opportunity to be much more. It could've at least had some redeeming qualities like a bear wisdom for example? So, yeah wasted potential.All in all, this movie tries so hard to be different from your average Rom/Com, mainly because it's R rated and it's about a teddy bear who can not only speak but smoke pot, drink bud lights, party, mess around, have random sex and date hookers. But that's about as different as it's going to get from a Rom/Com. A more intelligent sense of humor and witty dialogue would've really helped this movie stand out but the writing was totally ignored I guess. Because who wouldn't wanna watch an R rated movie of a Bear named Ted? It's like the producers said Oh, the premise alone should attracted audiences and makes it a good movie so why bother with anything else.I can only imagine Ted appealing to a more younger audience, an audience of 13-16 year olds and occasionally men. Because the sense of humor is don't ask why funny for that age category for some reason. Mainly because those kids believe that the likes of Family Guy will make them look cool, Hey I'm watching a potty filled humor tv show that my parents will kill me if they ever find out. I know everything about sex references and racist jokes now and they think am all innocent and sweet how special am I! I can visualize two 14 years old stealing this movie after it came out on dvd and their parents were watching it with a couple of adult friends while on weekend get together spent drinking beer, and just laughing their heads off at every single boring joke this film has to offer.I've outgrown this sense of humor, really it's no longer funny or shocking.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell, in his first lead action role in years, while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs, literally, straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek, flying cars, not unlike Philip K. Dick's own \"Blade Runner\" and \"Minority Report\".Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas, everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the Verhoeven/Arnold version where one-liners come post-Arnie-kill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more, and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one, and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, she kicks serious ass here.The script is a near complete rehash of the original, save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid (Farrell) where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas, the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects (seriously, this is CGI porn) that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fast-paced and the cinematography sleek (with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams), the music score by Harry Gregson- Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there, does its job, and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami; or even for that matter his legendary mentor, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences (\"Underworld\", \"Die Hard 4\") and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better, but then again, if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shot-for-shot remake with better characters, but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG-13 rating is justified, and there are indeed little homages to the original, but overall this remake is nothing more than a fast-paced, popcorn munching good waste of time, with some really nice CGI to chew on.However, I'd rather watch the old one again.

Fortunately, it was mostly everything I had hoped for: Big, powerful, bloody, gritty, unapologetic action interspersed with pretty laughable dialogue. Despite how pathetic that film often was whenever people weren't shooting each other, the original `Expendables' was still a good action movie because it nailed the right pacing and was able to etch out the right rhythm of bloody excitement and tough guys awkwardly shooting the breeze. Despite what all the highbrow critics thought, that movie worked both because of and in spite of Stallone's writing. It's sequel, however, does not.Somewhere in all the boringness of watching Stallone's latest cinematic effort, called `The Expendables 2,' I actually paused the movie to find out where exactly my friend and I were in the film because of how little action and how much boring, terrible dialogue there was. After nearly sixty minutes out of the film's 103 minute length, we had had exactly one action scene (all the way back at the beginning), and the rest of the schlock had been nothing more than Stallone's and Richard Wenk's awful, painful dialogue. The film went on for another five minutes or so before we finally got a quick action scene that wrapped up with a incredibly brief appearance of Chuck Norris, although I don't think we actually got to see him shoot anything.This is pretty much what the entire movie is. Although thankfully the snail's pace does pick up a noticeable amount in the movie's final third, most of E2 will simply bore you to tears, and given all the action and star power we were promised (including extended appearances by Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger), that is simply unacceptable. For the most part, the problem is the pacing, as I mentioned. We all knew that the dialogue was going to be bad coming into this, so it wasn't like we were expecting some Shakespearean or Dickensian level of character development or colloquy. That's not my beef with this movie. The problem is that there is just so much of this awful, boring-ass dialogue, and hardly any action at all for the first hour of the film, and when the action finally does pick up in the airport finale, none of the shootouts or hand-to-hand combat match the violence from the first movie. That latter point is not necessarily a huge mark against E2, because the action in the original `Expendables' is pretty damn good, but given the sleep-inducing pace of most of the film, the fact that we are not absolutely blown away by the action when it does happen is disappointing. Really the only action scene that is up to par with the over-the-top violence of the original is in the opening scene.With that said, the action is still better than average, and I will take anything over the awful line delivery and forced jokes that make up most of the movie. I have a hard time deciding which particular conversation is the worst in E2, since they are all pretty awful and there are a lot of them. Some of the terrible jokes stick out more than the regular \"character growth\" moments, though. Dolph Lundgren's pathetic running attempts at comedic relief as a former chemical engineer or a math wiz or a super-genius or something (I don't remember what it was) is pretty bad, but so is the incredibly forced Chuck Norris joke about a cobra. I don't know, it's just all so boring and bad, and the fact that there is just so much of it makes it all the more irritating.As for the film's impressive lineup, that too is letdown. Willis and Schwarzenegger actually do some shooting in this movie, which is a small plus, but we don't see Norris actually shoot a guy on screen until the finale, and Jet Li leaves after the opening battle scene less than half an hour into the movie. And yes, before you interject, Van Damme does something cool...at the very end of the story for three minutes. Jesus, Stallone, if a cast member has less than fifteen minutes of screen time, or kills fewer than ten people, can you please not bill them as a \"starring role?\"I don't know. I guess I just feel so cheated by the whole affair, and that's pretty pathetic considering that the action is pretty hard-hitting when it finally occurs (despite being underwhelming compared to the original). The first hour of E2 is so bad, and it's all because we have to watch a bunch of heavily muscled, macho, '80&#8242;s throwback guys pretending to be dramatic actors, when they should've stuck to what they did best and shot first and asked questions later. It would have been better than whatever the hell this is. Don't let people tell you that `The Expendables 2&#8242; is a revamped version of the original '80&#8242;s tribute. It's not. If anything, it's a watered down, lazy, half-assed version of the 2010 flick. It feels eerily like the outtakes from that movie, as if Simon West and Stallone simply took all the unused, cut footage from `The Expendables' and strung it together, and repackaged it to make another movie. It might as well be.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SCORE: 3/10+ The action is pretty solid...- ...when it actually happens.

I never doubted that there'd be a sequel, but if you want to think of this as an example of lightning striking twice, it can only serve to make the movie more noteworthy. I liked the first film enough to give it four stars and thus went into this one with reasonably high expectations - expectations which almost ended up being too high. The novelty of seeing a big collection of action heroes has been slightly reduced - partially by the film's delivery, partially by a bunch of other movies having copied the theme in recent years - and a few of the unfulfilled rumors regarding the cast list were particularly disappointing, but in the end, it ended up being a very well-rounded big-budget action flick that - however imperfectly - mixes deconstructive comedy with a varied collection of fulfilling adrenaline scenes.The story: when the newest Expendable (Liam Hemsworth,The Hunger Games) is killed during a mission by an evil mastermind looking to harvest a forgotten cache of plutonium (Jean-Claude Van Damme), the old team - featuring Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews - goes on a mission of vengeance to take down the villain and his forces.I think most fans who followed the development of the movie had their own hopes for potential new additions to the cast. Stallone himself mentioned Lorenzo Lamas, Jeff Speakman, and Olivier Gruner by name. The fact that none of these guys made it into the movie is disappointing, and it'll disappoint even more people that Jet Li disappears from the feature within the first twenty minutes. Additionally, Randy Couture's role has been reduced to the point that he's almost facetious to the picture, so his fans will probably be disappointed as well. I was personally appalled that a prettyboy with only three movies under his belt (at the time) was given access to such an elite ensemble, but luckily for me, his demise coincides with the arrival of Van Damme's return to the big screen, as well as that of number one henchman Scott Adkins (last seen in theaters forX-Men Origins: Wolverine). Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger were in the last flick, albeit as cameos to help sell the movie poster, but their vastly increased characterization and action participation almost makes them feel like brand new characters, particularly in Schwarzenegger's case. Chinese actress Yu Nan (who had played alongside Dolph Lundgren before inDiamond Dogs) fulfills the \"female Expendable\" role fans had been clamoring for, and while I would have vastly preferred seeing a more accredited face like Cynthia Rothrock or Michelle Yeoh in the part, Yu is both a good actress and a physically capable one. Rounding off the credited cast is Chuck Norris, who disappointingly isn't very physical: though he has the best entrance I've seen in a while, he only gets to shoot a bit and utter the expected Chuck Norris Fact during his approximate ten minutes of screentime.Oh yeah, Mickey Rourke's gone MIA, too.Where the action is concerned, I can only complain about its distribution: too much time elapses in the middle of the picture without any fighting or shooting going on. When either does happen, though, it tends to be good - sometimes very good. I recount at least three or four lengthy guns & effects battles, mixed with some nice vehicle-related sequences (at least half of these are CG-rendered, though, so I can't be as impressed by them as I'd otherwise be). I was very pleased that there's a scene near the end of the picture where almost all of the stars still alive at the time were caught up in an extensive gunfight. Of course, anyone who knows me will know that I was much more eager for the hand-to-hand fights, and I ended up satisfied. In pre-production, Stallone referred to this sequel as a \"love letter to the martial arts,\" and while I'm not sure this is exactly what it is, the fistfights we see are roundly good. Though the match-ups in the original film enticed me more (i.e. Lundgren vs. Li, Gary Daniels vs. Li & Statham), these here are categorically filmed better, having all but completely done away with the questionable camera angles and disappointing cutting of the originals. Disappointingly, neither Lundgren nor Couture nor the aforementioned Norris are given a clear spotlight to display their martial skills, but the battles which are highlighted - Jet battling a bunch of guys in a kitchen, Statham taking on a bunch of guys in a church, Statham fighting Adkins, and the finale between Stallone and Van Damme - are much better than I expected and definitely above the Hollywood standard. It's all pretty grounded stuff and satisfyingly violent with lots of improvised weapon usage. Though none of the brawls will win a nomination for \"fight of the year\" in my book, I'd go as far to say that the inevitable second sequel has a good amount of living up to do.Dramatically, the movie isn't impressive but still fun. I appreciate the comedy Dolph Lundgren is allowed and I like that Terry Crews' character is given a few more character scenes, since he was basically a stock figure in the original. Jean-Claude Van Damme, on a roll ever sinceJCVD, doesn't really get a chance to deliver the dark energy he's been perfecting but still manages to have fun with his character, exaggerating his accent and doing what he can with his limited action until the finale. With her mastery of the English language and smooth delivery, I can easily see Yu Nan growing into a performer along the lines of Maggie Q or Kelly Hu. Guys like Schwarzenegger and Willis are entertaining without even trying. The one thing that really got on my nerves about the characters was the nonstop banter between Stallone and Statham: yes, they've got good chemistry, but if I had to hear them glad-hand eachother one more time, I might've put popcorn in my ears for the remainder of their scenes.Story-wise, I prefer the first film, but the sequel definitely has its predecessor's number when it comes to action scenes. Chances are that fans of the original will receive \"The Expendables 2\" warmly, but even the hardcore action devotees who turned their backs on the original might find this one different enough to consider a different opinion.

I found myself thinking of that movie because Life of Pi opens in India and the cast is predominantly comprised of Indian actors. Like Slumdog Millionaire, the movie uses several actors to portray the main character at different ages. In fact, the older Pi is played by Irrfan Khan, who appears in both movies.The story is framed with the older Pi relating his story to a writer. We learn that Pi's father owned a zoo, and his mother worked there as a botanist. His father is fond of giving Pi advice, and one memorable lesson involves a demonstration of how dangerous tigers can be, and that they should not be treated like a pet or a friend.Pi is shown at four different ages, but the bulk of the story shows Pi as a young man, so Suraj Sharma receives the most screen time. Like Cast Away and 127 Hours, the movie relies on one actor holding our attention, and Sharma does a wonderful job of doing just that. It's his first role and he had to show a vast range of emotions in order for everything to work.The first part of the movie shows Pi's life as a young boy. We see him go to school, and ultimately fall in love. But his life (and the story) is shaken up when his mother and father inform him that they have decided to move the family to Canada. Along with some of the animals, they set sail for their new home. If you have seen the trailer, or even the poster for this movie, it's not a spoiler to reveal that Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. I imagine that's quite a selling point, as a lot of people would wonder how such a relationship could possibly work.Director Ang Lee overcomes the limitations of such an enclosed setting in several spectacular ways. It's fascinating to see how Pi tries to survive, as well as co-existing with a dangerous carnivore. The visual aspects of the movie are of the highest quality, and I would be shocked if the movie wasn't nominated in several technical categories. The tiger is convincing, but the visual effects also shine when we are shown some of the things that can happen at sea.I think Life of Pi is a movie that should be experienced without knowing too much of the story beforehand, so I am not going to reveal anything more about the plot. Although I will mention that the ending is open-ended and leaves you guessing about what really happened out on the ocean.Religion is an ever-present theme. The movie will ask you to think about why the events in our lives happen, and whether they are random or part of God's plan. But more than one religion is mentioned, and it's not done in an overbearing way.The script is well-written, and is a big reason why the story works. There is quite a bit of humor, but it's smart and feels natural.I'm not sure how many movies I have seen this year, but this is one of the best. The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving. I should also say that a few of the animals are hurt or even killed, so be warned if you are sensitive to such things. That said, you would see more brutality on a nature documentary like Planet Earth.Life of Pi grabbed my attention early and held it for two hours. It's more than special effects, with the screenplay and acting both standing out. I highly recommend it.Overall score 4.5/5", "qas": [{"question": "How was plot ?", "id": "8892863b4d72b72c13ce6b30385c8882", "answers": [{"text": "The story feels fresh and unusual", "answer_start": 2860}, {"text": "The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving", "answer_start": 2860}]}]}]}, {"title": "B005LAIIJY", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Quentin Tarantino is obviously a movie lover. He takes on so many genres in his film making that he creates a blend that is uniquely his own. Django Unchained is a reimagining of the 1960's spaghetti westerns and for the most part the film works. The viewer gets caught up in the action and the story progresses well if a little slowly at times. Set mostly in the pre Civil War South, Tarantino makes what he calls a \"Southern\" rather than the traditional Western. In telling his tale he takes on the institution of slavery and racial injustice.Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx) is a former slave who has been given his freedom in order to join Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a bounty hunter to track down and kill the vicious Brittle Brothers. Once this job is done Django is paid seventy-five dollars and given his freedom. Django  decides that he is good at the bounty hunting business and continues on in his  business venture with King. Django's ultimate goal is to find and free his wife Broomhilda Von Schaft (Kerry Washington) from slavery. Django and Schultz learn that she is now at the Mississippi plantation of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). In order to free her an elaborate ruse is set up involving Mandingo type fighting which is ultimately discovered by Candie's house servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) and the inevitable Tarantino bloodbath ensues.The film ,while excellent in its own right just doesn't stand up to earlier Tarantino efforts. While the screenplay and acting are very good throughout there is simply no reason that the almost three hour length was necessary. The movie slows considerably in the second act and the film 's ultra violent conclusion may be off putting to some viewers. This film was one of the features that I was most looking forward to of the Occar contenders and while good did not measure up to the likes of Argo or Zero Dark Thirty.

Furthermore, like many, I had heard the stories of a confused script and a new ending forced to be filmed.  However, upon seeing the film, I found it to be a gripping and intense experience.  I watched the blu-ray unrated version yesterday and my opinion hasn't changed.This is an epic film of a world catastrophe going from Philadelphia, (actually Scotland) to North Korea to Israel (actually Malta) and a tense conclusion in Wales.  Like so many of the films of today, this film would not have been possible without CGI, particularly the scene of thousands of zombies climbing over each other to get over an enormous wall protecting Jerusalem. (Probably the type of wall we could use along our porous southern border.)Unlike The Walking Dead, where the world suffers a similar disaster, these zombies do not shamble along, they run and run fast.  And they bite, thats the way the zombie virus is spread. Pitt is surprisingly good (and he should be since he is one of the film's producers.)  I also like Mirielle Enos as his wife.  I've enjoyed her on the AMC series The Killing, and since she is always so grim and depressed on that series, it is nice to see her play a normal role and actually smile here (although, to be frank, the events of this film do not really give one much to smile about.)As stated, this is an unrated cut.  There were some scenes that did not seem too familiar to me although I have to admit that I don't remember what they were.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray were fine.  The special features consisted of several relatively short documentaries on the making of the film. (This is not a Peter Jackson film with 10 hours of special features.)  The &#34;making of&#34; documentaries were fine and just about everyone was interviewed with the exception of Pitt.  (I guess he was too busy.)In conclusion, this is a very exciting, fairly violent and bloody epic  that keeps the suspense and your interest up throughout.

The base material, Rand's novel, was certainly intriguing enough, and from what I saw of the trailers, this movie looked very good.Now that I have seen part 1 (the book was so long, to do it justice they have to make the movie in several parts) I have to say I am hooked and will eagerly look for the subsequent parts.To start with, it is an intriguing story, part mystery, part sci-fi, and heavy social commentary. The characters are very strong, and the only down side is a bit of naivet&eacute; on Rand's part about how easily a government can be corrupted by misplaced altruism (although in the movie it is really corporate shenanigans to beat each other out of the market) and how blameless and honorable fiercely independent capitalists are (which history has proved may not always be the case).That was Rand's perspective and the movie seems to be faithful to her vision, which is great -- because movies should be faithful to their source material.So, if you have problems with the philosophy or politics of the movie, look to the original author and not the film. The film is being faithful.Instead, enjoy this film for the breadth and scope of the grand adventure it displays. It delivers plenty of eye candy -- and some food for thought.I have read Atlas Shrugged -- as a book it is a bargain because it is so LONG! You get your money's worth with an engrossing story that goes on and on. The movie follows suit quite nicely.I won't go over the complex plot, but will point out what I think makes this a valuable film:1. It follows the book very closely. Things you like and don't like about the book are here pretty much as the author intended, so the emotional impact is as strong in the film as it is in the novel.2. The production values are high. I have read it was a low budget movie, but it certainly appeared high budget to me. For one thing we see how the rich and \"famous\"--  or infamous... take your pick depending on the character -- live and \"hang out\". Everything in the scenery, makeup, and effects look very genuine and believable.3. The movie, like the book, maintains a good level of suspense. Will Reardon Metal fail? Will the John Galt Line succeed in its first run? What is the mysterious \"super engine\" prototype and who created it? Having read the book, I know the answer and I won't give it away here. Suffice it to say, when we find out, there is a definite emotional experience to it.4. The actors are all very good, and there are a few easily recognizable character actors as well as some new comers. As for their characters -- the good guys are reasonably good, and the bad guys are reasonably slimy. But be warned, Rand's villains often come off stronger than her heroes in that they engender a stronger emotional reaction. This movie follows that line of thinking.5. The musical score and soundtrack are excellent. Appropriate volume (nicely equalized) and they avoid the clich&eacute; of musical clashes to alert the audience when something unexpected is about to happen. Nice job.6. Because this is a bit of a hi-tech story (the new metal, the new designs for bridges and other technological advances) they need some CGI effects to pull it off. When we see the new John Galt \"super\" train, it really does look super! I'm a sucker for trains anyway, and to see this neat high speed rail line, even as CGI, was very exciting. It was even more so because much of the second half of the movie is filmed in Colorado with amazing natural vistas and beautiful skylines. This could have been a travel film, the natural scenery was photographed so well.------------------------------Conclusion:If you want to see a movie that is refreshingly close to the original source (with all its benefits and faults), a film that has a \"rich\" look to it, a film that has suspense, mystery a bit of sci-fi or at least high tech, and some really good looking actors doing a great and believable job, then I think you will enjoy this film.5-stars for a job well done that I really enjoyed.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the actor attractive?", "id": "6ab7e39d3a23d159988cadc541fd74a6", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B005S9EI2Y", "paragraphs": [{"context": "In spite of my love for (some of) Von Trier's movies, I don't hesitate to call this one plain disappointing.

While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave.

The first half of the movie is terribly slow, showing in hundred different ways how \"melancholic\" the character Justine is.

In this movie, we watch the inner lives of several characters \"of a certain age\" unfold and expand. With the bloom of youth past, retirement upon them and circumstances inducing radical change, all of them decide to retire in India at the Marigold Hotel. When they arrive, they find that the hotel isn't the luxurious retreat for the elderly that was described in the brochures that led them there. It is not without its charms, however, and the manner in which the retirees meet both the good and the bad of their new home lays the groundwork for their blended individual stories. The dialogue is excellent, the cast and the acting is brilliant, and the message is hopeful without violating believability. Baby boomers will see themselves in one or more of the characters' situations, and they will come away from the film with a renewed sense of hope and worth.The film's perspective on two ways to grow older is beautifully executed. Not all the characters \"make it.\" Given the same opportunity for adjustment and change as their companions, a couple of them cannot forgive, hope or move forward. Others, however, find a new beginning by embracing change and welcoming a future which is completely different from the past they left behind.In all, the movie is provocative. It is funny, sad, engaging and substantive.

Affleck went to great lengths to make the film look aged and grainy while there were plenty of bad 70s hairstyles, bushy porn star moustaches, and unbuttoned shirts with huge collars that scream \"in case of emergency disco dancing pop up.\" The camera work deserves some accolades, as well. Near the beginning of the film, there's a scene with a helicopter where you feel like you're riding right along with the pilot. The shot starts at ground level and then slowly shoots up into the air.The performances are pretty strong all around. Affleck portrays a man in purgatory; not only is he in charge of six people's lives but he's also separated from his wife who has custody of their son. Affleck's Tony Mendez character seems mostly emotionally absent the entire film and rightfully so. The six Americans stranded in Iran all portray panic and anxiousness very well. John Goodman as make-up effects artist John Chambers is fantastic as is Alan Arkin as movie director Lester Siegel. Goodman is funny and charming right from the start while Arkin has this no BS type of humor that comes with all his years in the movie business. His quick wit, particularly during the meeting him and Affleck have regarding the rights to \"Argo,\" instantly makes him the highlight of the film.Ever since Bryan Cranston became a household name in \"Breaking Bad,\" he's been popping up in a lot of movies; \"Red Tails,\" \"John Carter,\" \"Madagascar 3,\" \"Rock of Ages,\" \"Total Recall,\" and now \"Argo\" in 2012 alone. He usually brings that same intensity you love him for in \"Breaking Bad\" to every role he has even if the project he's a part of isn't very good. \"Argo\" may be his best effort film-wise so far. He's just so good as a man who has no other options; when his character is at the end of his rope. His form of frustrated panic is outstanding and thanks to the magic of R-rated films has a chance to be completely unfiltered here.What's disappointing about \"Argo\" is that it's really dull. Speaking as someone who isn't really interested in the subject matter of the film, any interest at all was solely based on the feedback it's received. Any scenes revolving around developing the fake movie and that include John Chambers or Lester Siegel are immediately entertaining, but that's obviously secondary. There's a lot of sitting around and waiting and drinking. How Tony Mendez drinks so much without showing any signs of feeling it is kind of astounding.Seeing the mechanics of it all as it's happening gets pretty redundant. There's this blue balls mentality to the film where it teases so many things that could happen but then they don't or it strings you along for so long and then is just like \"Oh, nevermind.\" You can only watch people talking, having things go wrong, and them scrambling to figure out a last minute solution so many times before you figure out where things are headed. It really seems difficult having knowledge of the events the film is based on and how everything turns out and still being able to enjoy the film. It seems like knowing the answer to the riddle beforehand would make it less enjoyable.While \"Argo\" will more than likely be nominated for best picture at The Academy Awards that doesn't mean it's going to cater to everyone or that anyone who sees it is going to fall in love with it. If it wasn't for the performances of John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston, it would actually be pretty boring. How bad the fake sci-fi movie seems pulls you in more than the horrible events going on in Iran.Some moments are tense, but many are portraying it as this overwhelming sensation that never lets up during its two hour duration and that just isn't the case; whether or not you're interested in politics or the history surrounding the events of the film will play or big role in your enjoyment of the film itself. \"Argo\" may be a good film that was just viewed by someone who isn't its target audience, but in the meantime just seems like another Ben Affleck related project that's being over praised because of who's attached to it and its bureaucratic subject matter.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the scene?", "id": "c2071339ac2955a3da8832dba188f453", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I'm no history professor, but where's the rest of the story?

Say what you want about Affleck's &#34;Gigli&#34; days but the actor continues to prove he has what it takes to pull off a challenging role. Affleck's Mendez is meticulous and intelligent yet comfortable in not being recognized for the true hero that he was.

The story never waivers or lingers longer than it should and the introductory scene, as well as the white-knuckle finale are some of the most tense moments in recent movie history. The film also contains a lot of comedic moments, mainly as it pokes fun of the movie industry it's portraying. There's a real dark comedy feel to the film and Arkin and Goodman especially have some great lines.While I can't vouch for the validity of the historical accuracy behind the story, the film presented is engaging, political, and hard to forget. The movie is more than deserving of the plethora of awards it received and the hype it's obtained. Any pundits who claimed Affleck didn't have the chops to make it as a director in Hollywood can finally be silenced.

The seventies `taches and comb-overs are spot on. The cinematography is impressive: the grainy, orangey colours look like real original seventies newsreel footage, and you only realise they can't be when a 747 flies overhead tracked on a static camera which must be a couple of thousand feet in midair. That is very, very sympathetically rendered CGI indeed.Ben Affleck has his hands full, co-producing and directing as well as taking the lead role: he is Tony Mendez, a CIA field agent who specialises in \"exfiltration\" of vulnerable American nationals from iffy foreign situations. They don't get iffier than the Iran hostage crisis of 1979. In a frenetic dramatisation of the initial storming we see embassy staff dumbfounded that their walls could possibly be breached (\"but we're technically on American soil!\") and stunned that the Iranian police wouldn't come to sort the situation out for them.Ultimately 52 of the American Embassy staff were caught and held hostage for 444 days. What is less well-known is that six others had the bright idea of scarpering out the back door as the students stormed the front, escaping to the questionable sanctuary of a foreign city of 4 million people whom would like nothing better than \"to pour American blood on their cornflakes\".Having been turned away by the Brits, the Swedes and the Kiwis they wind up as reluctant house guests of the only westerners who'll take them in: the Canadian ambassador and his wife.Meanwhile, back in Quantico, CIA subsection chief Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) is put in charge of working out what to do now. His best guy is Mendez. Mendez' idea, even though the best by a long shot, is a total stinker: have the six pretend to be a Canadian film crew scouting for locations for a sci fi movie, in revolutionary Iran. It beat \"cycling 300 mountainous miles to the Turkish border in the middle of winter\", which was the other option.Early stages are worked as a skilful drama: There is a clever juxtaposition of the Iranian students' trumped up show trial of the American hostages on spying against a public script reading in Hollywood for the titular sci fi film. The preparation for the phoney film is a comedy masterclass from John Goodman and Alan Arkin as a pair of Hollywood old hands brought in to make a credible backstory.Affleck is the epitome of the no nonsense, unflappable field agent. He also rocks superb facial hair that he really should keep.Despite the machinations of the State Department, the film caper never quite gets nixed, and Mendez goes in to Tehran. Now the film enters overdrive: the Iranians have twigged that six diplomats are missing and are running down every angle. We fret that the Canadians' domestic help may have twigged too, and spilled beans. It becomes a race against the clock, with a couple of great set pieces, one of which is in Tehran's grand bazaar (deputised for by Istanbul's bazaar, which withTaken 2andSkyfallhas hosted its fair share of blockbusters recently).Affleck's depiction of the Iranian revolutionaries is sympathetic (that is, more \"Arrec Barwin\" than Spottiswood), it being made clear at the outset that the real villain was the Shah, his presence on American soil being what precipitated the situation in the first place.There are the odd unnecessary tropes: a daybreak shot of the grand mosque as the Muezzin calls the faithful to prayer makes an uncalled-for appearance, and Affleck can't resist the temptation to over-cheese the ending, but these small faults aside, with a fine ensemble cast ably supported by Goodman and Arkin's comic relief, and assured directing and cinematography, this is well worth its two hours' running time.Olly Buxton", "qas": [{"question": "What is the quality of the actor?", "id": "8acbf956cacc4d4963cd3de2b9071149", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Ben Affleck the actor has never impressed me much, a journeyman who has made some real stinkers (Gigli,Surviving Christmas), but Ben Affleck the filmmaker has really come into his own. His third film as a director (Gone Baby Gone,The Town) is a first-rate political thriller with a pulpish fervor and keen intelligence. The Iran hostage crisis of 1979-81 takes on revitalized life in this engrossing 2012 movie with great period detail and a well-turned screenplay by first-timer Chris Terrio. The recent Benghazi killings only makes this story resonate more with an event hidden from history prior to 1997 propulsively dramatized here as a turning point in the precarious state of U.S. relations with the entire Arab world. It's fascinating to consider the truth behind the \"best bad idea\" the CIA could concoct to rescue six U.S. embassy workers who managed to escape the compound. There's a blessedly brief prologue chronicling the events that led to the Shah's exile to the U.S. and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini and fundamentalist Islam in Iran leading to the tense hostage situation.The six workers found refuge at the Canadian embassy. With the CIA at a loss to figure out how to sneak them out of Iran, exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez is inspired a bit ofBattle For The Planet Of The Apesto come up with an incredulous plot to have the six pose as a Canadian film crew who were flown to Teheran to scout locations for a phony sci-fi film that gives this movie its name. Mendez enlists prosthetics expert, real-life makeup artist John Chambers, to help convince veteran producer Lester Siegel to get studio backing for the fake epic. Siegel insists the picture look credible, so he buys an existing script, holds a reading with real actors at the Beverly Hilton, and starts an advertising campaign in the trade papers. All the gears are set in motion as Mendez's boss Jack O'Donnell miraculously gains approval for the far-fetched plan. Mendez flies to Teheran with doctored passports in hand and tries to convince the six to act out their roles with precise detail before they get recognized by Iranian officials as escapees from the embassy.This race against the clock provides the tension in the film's final act, which comes down to a rather implausible albeit extremely thrilling chase scene at the airport. With Affleck in mostly stoic mode as Mendez, the cast is solidly effective with three unsurprising standouts - John Goodman as the avuncular Chambers, Bryan Cranston as the acerbic O'Donnell, and Alan Arkin who steals all his scenes with ease as Siegel. All the period detail is excellent from the tacky clothes to the Turkish locations standing in for Iran. The slightly washed-out documentary-style of Rodrigo Prieto's (Brokeback Mountain) cinematography perfectly captures the crowded, often squalid atmosphere. There's also an evocative use of vintage TV news clips featuring Mike Wallace's infamous interview with Khomeini. The final explanation of how the real story of the mission unfolded is provided in a voice-over by Jimmy Carter, who was President when it all took place up until the rest of the hostages were released. The film is a genre picture at heart but a historically evocative and emotionally powerful one thanks to Affleck's impressive work behind the camera.", "qas": [{"question": "How is an intense movie?", "id": "a020a8b2801c6cc25405f3705bc450cb", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B0060MYKYY", "paragraphs": [{"context": "My wife and I decided one day just before the last xmas holidays to finally see it as everyone that was into it kept raving about it.

Maybe that is why none of the actors in this take on the classic novel seem convincing whatsoever. Every performance seems as unreal and phony as the CGI settings that surround it. Another terrible thing is the style over substance approach of this movie. For example, when Gatsby and Nick are driving into the city there is much important dialog being spoken - but it is all but lost to the winds as the ADHD-afflicted camera/computer dart about the car and the road, showing us every view and angle imaginable, yet in doing so scene-stealing the stuff of the only real things in this sequence - and that is the actors, whose words are subjugated to the style. And, sadly, this is par for the course for most all of the movie.The argument could be made that the world of Gatsby is, indeed, a superficial, phony, unreal world - and that this essential vapidness is what is being captured via the mind-deadening overuse of the movie-killing Monster that is CGI.  But this is a razor's edge.  In the case of this film, there are nicks and cuts galore that threaten the heart of the story, the reality of the romance below the glitz and glamor. Too many scenes are simply run over roughshod, the same way Wilson's wife gets the deadly bump from the yellow Rolls. And then there is the odious soap opera-ish musical underscore to the whole thing that tries too hard to make us feel what the visuals and dialog may fail to make us feel.  It creeps into every scene, further enhancing the phoniness of the entire affair. As to the use of hip hop, the question is why?  I understand the argument that contemporary music is used to make modern audiences feel more relevant to the moment of a period film, but then why not update fashions as well?  Cars, too?  Heck, why not just uproot the whole story and plant it in a 21st century setting?  The point is - where does it end?  And why NOT utilize the jazz music from the actual era being depicted?  The popular music then was a helluva lot better than the music of today! One reason for the choice in music may have been to be...controversial.  Controversy gets people talking - and in this world anymore there is nothing worse than not being talked about!When will money-mad movie makers and their too obliging, too accepting audiences reach a long overdue saturation point and realize that more often than not less is more - and that just because a thing can be technologically done doesn't therefore mean it should be.

Does Skyfall deliver, or does Adele let it crumble? It has a LOT (and I mean a helluva lot) to make up for, and I feel that critics fawned over it a bit too much, probably just ecstatic that it wasn't Quantum of Soulless. I enjoyed some of Skyfall, but overall I felt deflated and occasionally a bit bored. There's more subtext here than usual, but the plot is full of holes and it weighs down the action too much.After a list of undercover agents is stolen (it is never explained how as the movie jumps in after the story has already started) Bond goes off in pursuit of the culprit and is accidentally gunned down by his colleague during a scrap aboard a train moving over a massive viaduct. M believes him dead and is due to be hauled over the coals for analogue incompetence in a digital age. But Bond knows he lives twice and guesses he'll die another day. He's broken and beaten-down, though he insists he's good enough for another shot at catching the baddie.And so enters Javier Bardem as Silva, a charismatic ex-agent (it's never made clear if he was a double-oh) who lives for revenge. He IS a great villain and is wonderful to watch, bringing an unusual amount of sadness and empathy to the role. He wants to get back at M for selling him out some years previous, and as Bond does everything in his power to protect her they come across as siblings fighting for mother's attention and approval. It gives the film an emotional heart that Bond doesn't usually have.I feel that this is undone by such ludicrous development and bad scripting as Silva goes about executing a years-in-development plan that relies on way too much contrivance. Where on Earth does Silva get his endless supply of goons? Does he put an ad in the paper? Wanted: Henchman for revenge plot. Must be willing to dress the part (no uniform provided) and die for me. Meets national minimum wage. You can have a gun if you want.And, for that matter, where does he get his supplies, equipment, helicopters? For a man living as a ghost he sure is connected. Yes, I know I am pedantically picking apart an action movie plot, but Skyfall promotes itself as more serious and a return to form. The aforementioned complaints feel like leftover elements from the Bronson era, and I do feel like it is high time to fire Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. With this fresh start they should have brought in stronger writers, or perhaps just employ a single writer for consistency.B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe and Naomi Harris pop in as the Bond girls but neither are really given anything to do, the former having about 10 lines of dialogue. And with the franchise adapting to modern sensibilities it feels a bit corny having Bond jump into bed (or in this case shower) with a girl he met five minutes earlier. He's a bit too detached from them for their presence to have any impact on the plot.There are many attempts to give this entry a better continuity with previous movies, and while I really like this, it feels a little (just a little) fanboy-ish. Am I the only one who thinks that the Aston Martin (in all of it's lovely gray-ishness) is an ugly-as-sin automobile? Or that the Walther PPK is a wimpy-as-hell gun? I've seen potato guns that look more intimidating. Also, the film explores Bond's roots and history more so then ever before, but the big revelation about M's past that has been teased in the pre-release hype is thoroughly non-existent. Judi Dench does get a lot more to do this time around and really does become the emotional core of the Oedipal fracas between Bond and Silva.Roger Deakin shoots the entire film in Redcode RAW and it looks L-O-V-E-L-Y. Every scene has its own unique aesthetic and atmospheric production design. Really, really good work there. All done digitally, obviously, and while it's gorgeous for this 50th anniversary adventure, I hope it doesn't become standard practice. 35mm may be the past, but I hope it sticks around for the future.David Arnold is gone. In his place is Thomas Newman, who unfortunately scores the film with no decent melodies and rarely even uses the Bond theme or even the melody from the title song. How I miss John Barry. There is a fare amount of globe-trotting, including Turkey, China, Macau, and the Scottish highlands. However, too much of this cuts back to mundane London. Stuart Baird (having seemingly abandoned his career as a director) cuts it altogether expertly, but he can't add excitement to scenes that have been written so flatly.I've always felt that Bond movies are defined by the second unit and stunt co-ordination. With the action reserved for short bursts in Skyfall it allows Sam Mendes a chance to put his own stamp on the film. This is both good and bad. Turning a Bond in a character study is a bold chance to take, but they should have turned up the action more. I like gritty, realistic stunts and choreography, but Bond isn't really the franchise for it. There is a sweet spot in-between invisible cars and fist-fighting and I am not sure that Skyfall has found it.It's not the darkest or angriest Bond adventure (that honor goes to Licence to Kill), but it sure is most atmospheric and downbeat.

Everything they did used to become an instant classic, but now it seems they have a couple of hits, but a majority of misses. I did not enjoy the humor and did not really find the message to be all that inspiring. There are plenty of better movies to watch if you are looking for a good message. Veggie Tales comes to mind. They have great message and plenty of humor that even we adults can appreciate without being vulgar.Also, the bad-guy self help group was just thrown in so they could show off a few classic characters.

Hi, I have finally decide to start being a reviewer again, considering that my last one was for SummerSlam '11. This event had 3 matches that I was extremely excited about. I hate long intros so lets go to the review.1. World Heavyweight Championship Match:Daniel Bryan(c) vs. Sheamus (0:18)Not alot of people should have expected much from this match but 18 SECONDS!!!! OK, I don't understand why they would even put this match first. Last year, there was supposed to be a US Championship Match between these men, but it made the pre-show, lasted 2 minutes then ended in a no-contest. To make up for it, the match was made a main event but it felt like once again barely made the card. I won't spoil it, but it is what it is.  No rating.2. Randy Orton vs. Kane (10:56)I knew this match would be good. This was a match worth watching, and it can be acceptable for a WM match. It had a decent pace, nice back-and-forth maneuvers, and took up a fair time slot. Nice and unsuspecting ending, not much more. 8/103. Intercontinental Championship:Cody Rhodes(c) vs. Big Show (5:18)At least this match was better than expected. It was no squash, and it had fair back-and-forth pace, for a match like this. Watc it or not, still alright, 7/104. Beth Phoenix and Eve vs. Maria Menounos and Kelly Kelly (6:49)I normally say that these matches suck, but I liked it. 7.5/10 4 Matches in and were not even done with the first hour5. Hell in a Cell Match \"The End of an Era\"The Undertaker vs. Triple H (Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee)(30:52)The world was waiting to see how Undertaker would fight his 20th match at WM,and I have the answer; BALD! HIAC was a good touch to this match, its too bad this match was slow. Trust me, I liked it, and this isn't negative, but it's not like HBK vs. Taker at WrestleMania XXV. The match last year was bvery good, which gave more hype to this match. Problems included, slow pace, and little use of different weapons. 9/106. Santino Marella, R-Truth, Kofi Kingston, Booker T, The Great Khali and Zack Ryder (Team Teddy) vs.David Otunga, Dolph Ziggler, Mark Henry, Jack Swagger, The Miz and Drew McIntyre (Team Johnny)(10:38)It's about time they included a 12-man tag Match at WM, I don't havve much to say about this match, can't give away every match. 8/107. WWE Championship Match:CM Punk(c) vs. Chris Jerciho (22:21) \"YES! YES! YES!\" Sorry, wrong match. Anyway, fantastic match. Way better than expected, and that's saying something. This match was inside, outside, back, forth, pin, submission, kicking out, reaching ropes, so much action. The storyline of Jericho making fun of Punk's family didn't suprise me. But, anyway, this match rocked! Two submission and high-flying specialists fighting to determine the \"Best in the World\" made this great. Everything did. 9/108. \"Once in a Lifetime\" Singles MatchThe Rock vs. John Cena (30:34)The most hyped-up wrestling match in history. A whole year ago, it was announced, and I have waited just that long. All of the Rock Bottoms to Cena before this match were pretty much equal to the amount in this match, same with Attitude Adjustments. This was face-paced and amazing. Memorable moments were at the beginning when one side of the the crowd chanted \"Lets Go Cena\" and the other side chanted \"Cena Sucks\" similar to WM 18. The ending was great also, I suspected it, but I doubt that a lot of people did. This match was worth the year. Could be Match of the Year, lets see if 2012 goes as good as '11 did. 9.5/10In the end, I did give this event 4 stars, I decided to bump this up because I think people will enjoy this more than I have, it seems like that already happened. In one night, we had 3 major Match of the Year Candidates. It's nice to know Rock at least won, then left.I doubt changing my review will affect anything, so if your'e reading, it's your opinion.

Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is an able-bodied seaman who has trouble adapting to life after the war. He may have been mentally disturbed before that, but we aren't shown enough of his background to make that determination.We are shown something of Quell's attempts to hold down a regular job -- he seems to have a gift for photography -- but he's quick to anger and attacks one of his customers without apparent provocation. He's also an alcoholic, and we see him drinking all manner of questionable substances, some of which appear to be potentially lethal. When he's accused of poisoning someone with one of his concoctions, he seeks refuge on a ship.This is where the film gives the audience a glimmer of hope that it will develop into something interesting. This ship is run by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who claims to be a writer, doctor, nuclear physicist, theoretical philosopher, and a great many more things. Dodd is fascinated by human beings and psychology, and wants to understand Quell and help him with his obvious anger issues. Dodd has his own way of doing things and his psychoanalysis produces the most memorable scenes in the movie.Dodd is married to Peggy (Adams), but she's just as unpleasant as the rest of the characters. She barely had any lines, and most of the ones she did have were obscene.Quell frequently fantasizes about women, as outlined in an early masturbation scene on the beach with a girl fashioned out of sand. This theme is continued when he pictures women naked at a gathering.If this were a story about Dodd's quest to heal Quell, I might be satisfied with it, but the plot meanders along without any obvious conclusion.I consider myself a patient viewer, and I appreciate all manner of films that have slow plots, hidden messages, and flawed characters. Unfortunately, The Master left me disappointed.The final 30 minutes were thought-provoking. I found myself thinking whether I should walk out, and whether anyone would mind if I were to take off my right shoe and scratch my foot. I also wondered whether time was moving differently all of a sudden, and if this was the same Paul Thomas Anderson who gave is There Will Be Blood and Magnolia.The individual components of the film were mostly in place; the acting was fine, the cinematography and score worked, and Anderson presented a convincing picture of New York in the 1950s.

It currently holds a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its unique story (a rarity in films these days), excellent acting, writing, and (despite its modest budget) special effects. Naturally, expectations were high for his follow up, Elysium. After viewing Blomkamp's second film, one wonders whether he was pressed for time, because it plays out like a first draft in need of heavy revision.In the year 2154, the ultra wealthy live on Elysium, a utopian space station where crime, sickness, and war are nonexistent. Everyone else is stuck on an overpopulated, impoverished earth. One man, however, has the means to change all of that and bring equality to the two worlds.There isn't a singular flaw that can be attributed to Elysium's catastrophic failure, but \"absolutely no character development\" is towards the top of the list. Our protagonist, Max (played by Matt Damon) is an ex-con who's trying to stay on the \"straight and narrow\". It's difficult to care about him because he is essentially a cardboard cutout, like every character in this movie. The squalor the earthlings live in is portrayed with excellent, stark imagery, but viewers need more than imagery to stay invested in the \"good\" characters and their plight. \"Why should we root for Max? What makes him so special?\" It's unfortunate that Blomkamp doesn't answer these questions.Some of the characters are an extreme hindrance to the success of the film. Jodie Foster plays Delacourt, Elysium's cruel, scheming Secretary of Defense who has a penchant for poor acting including, but not limited to, cringe-inducing lines unbecoming of a two-time academy award winning actress. Kruger (played by Sharlto Copley of District 9 fame) is meant to be a fun-to-watch villain, but Delacourt's personal mercenary has an incredibly obnoxious, pseudo-French/cockney accent that would be hilarious in a Monty Python movie, but it's distracting and less than intimidating in this one. The actors are not entirely to blame; it's difficult for a good actor/actress to perform well when given poor lines.The environments, spaceships, robots, and weapons are a visual treat, as expected. The action scenes have inventive elements, but they are too few and far between, often relying heavily on slow-motion. Ultimately, the film lacks character development and substance, both of which are essential for the kind of story Blomkamp is trying to tell.Considering how great District 9 was, and the enormous potential Elysium had, it's obvious Blomkamp has some great ideas; it's just a matter of allowing them to develop. 4/10", "qas": [{"question": "How is the movie?", "id": "7ef4df4403cfb71baab9e11b2160e18f", "answers": [{"text": "citing its unique story (a rarity in films these days), excellent acting", "answer_start": 256}]}]}, {"context": "Elysium, is a fantastic movie.

I'm not sure why they called it elysium, considering how they presented it, they should have just called it Irvine.  Anyways, earth bad, elysium good, got it?As the movie unfolds, you see how dirty and polluted earth is and how clean and safe elysium is.  Earth is patrolled by a force of police-robots.  These robots are built on earth and we soon learn that Matt Damon works at a factory where the robots are built; how uplifting...There's a subplot involving a sick kid and rebel force whose goal is to invade elysium.  On elysium, the citizens can be treated by a medical machine that will cure any ailment you have, including disease, broken bones, etc...  I don't remember if the movie explains if these machines are in the people's homes are at the hospital, but either way, Damon gets caught up in  a plan to get to elysium, hack the sysytem so everyone can become citizens and have access to these machines and be able to save the sick girl.So as you have figured out by know hopefully, yes, the movie is about free health care for everyone.  If you don't enjoy that part of the movie and can get over it, there's an interesting movie aside, and you see Damon take on the police-robots(with the help of a mechanic torso) and his journey to elysium while being targeted by an assassin(played by the guy who was Mudoch on the recent A-Team movie) sent by the powers of elysium.As a sci-fi movie, it is entertaining, there's many shots of the landscape of earth, the sky is bright white and you understand the idea behind it that space travel has become so easy that elysium and likewise other plants are just a hop on a plane away; the only problem with the whole scenario being the division of humans in an \"ideal\" place and into the not so ideal place(like the Time Machine).This movie is definitely worth a viewing, just don't expect Blade Runner level imagination.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the character?", "id": "ad141706a1dbe082efc9aba887dd0c95", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B008JFUNKU", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Whenever I watch a film like Captain Phillips, my immediate reaction is always, &#8220;That actually happened?!?&#8221; When dealing with the world of fiction, the audience can easily accept any scenario without question because, in the back of their mind, everyone knows the events are not real. When dealing with non-fiction, however, this mindset changes drastically. Now we are watching a story based on a living, breathing human being and, depending on the narrative, this realization could be unsettling, which is the perfect word to describe Captain Phillips: unsettling. The film is raw and unforgiving in its execution, and the ending is as beautiful as it is emotional.Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is a ship captain who is in charge of the MV Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship loaded with food and supplies. His destination is the poverty-stricken city of Mombasa, which he and his crew will reach by traveling through the Horn of Africa. Unfortunately, this part of the sea is littered with pirates, mainly from Somalia, so the risk is high for everyone on board. The fear of being taken over by pirates soon becomes a reality as Phillips and crew fight off approaching pirate boats. However, because the ship is unarmed, one of the boats manages to commandeer the ship, and Phillips must fight for his life and the safety of his crew.Surprisingly, the narrative in Captain Phillips is extremely dense, which is why the film wastes no time throwing the viewer into the action. Within moments of meeting Phillips, the captain finds himself on the ship, meeting the crew, and setting sail. I wasn&#8217;t expecting things to move at such a rapid pace, but the further I got into the movie, the more it became apparent as to why the film starts the way it does. Although it may not have been advertised as such, this is a complex story that relies on heavy emotion almost as much as it does on high intensity, so in order to receive the appropriate reaction, they needed as much detail as possible in all the right places.For the most part, the film succeeds in accomplishing this task, which is shocking given the fact the story follows Phillips, his crew, and the Somalians. With the exception of the crew, the audience builds up a certain emotional connection with Phillips through the events that transpire, and the same can be said about the Somalians, to a certain extent. These pirates aren&#8217;t acting out for personal gain per se; they are acting out because their country is struggling. As the film progresses, Phillips begins to truly understand this, and he tries to use this to his advantage through persuasion. Although I personally would have liked to see more from the crew, I understand why they were excluded due to the film&#8217;s current running time.Another minor complaint of mine comes through the use, or lack thereof, of forced subtitles. After doing some light research, I&#8217;m under the impression that the forced subtitles were present in the theatrical release, but this is never made clear to those who watch the film on DVD/Blu-Ray. Apparently there are subtitles for the Somali language, but they have to be activated in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu. As a result, my family went through the entire movie ignorant as to what the Somalian pirates were saying, and it became a bit taxing because they make up a good 50% of the dialogue. I will say, though, that it allowed me to better sympathize with Phillips because he too had no idea what was going on. Their language is foreign and incomprehensible, and this only makes the situation all the more frightening. So it was kind of a win/lose situation, but it is something everyone should be made aware of.My biggest complaint, however, is in regards to the obnoxious shaky cam that is arguably Captain Phillips' biggest downfall. Paul Greengrass' work on the Bourne films suffered from the same issue, but those were at least a little understandable due to the constant action. The shaky cam in Captain Phillips, on the other hand, is just the result of bad camera work. There are never any demanding fight sequences, there aren&#8217;t any crazy firefights, and there is no real reason why this should even be a problem. Majority of the film consists of Phillips and company having conversations, walking across the ship, or sitting down. That&#8217;s it. I just about lost it when the shot switched to a silent, still Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi), and the camera was swaying all over the place.Although the shaky cam did manage to take me out of the experience on occasion, the performances always managed to pull me right back in. Considering this was his first film, Barkhad Abdi was a blast to watch on screen. His heavy accent made Abduwali all the more menacing, and his facial expressions displayed someone who was truly conflicted with the severity of the situation. Another surprise standout was Michael Chernus, who plays first officer Shane Murphy. He was always an attention grabber in the scenes he was in, and I would have liked to see more of him. The real accomplishment, though, came from Tom Hanks, who seems to outdo himself time and time again. His performance left me speechless as I fought back tears during the film&#8217;s final moments, and this will probably go down as one of his best performances.Overall Score: 8.8/10 - Is Captain Phillips perfect? No, but there is no denying the film&#8217;s excellence. The film manages to immerse its audience with ease, and the performances across the board were fantastic. Unfortunately, the story&#8217;s density made it impossible for the writers to include all the details that would have truly left me satisfied, like the impact these events had on the crew, and the film&#8217;s shaky cam never ceased to be a huge annoyance. Taking that into consideration, Captain Phillips succeeds more than it fails, and that&#8217;s all that matters. Those looking for a balls-to-the-wall action flick should look elsewhere, but if you want something that will truly stick with you, look no further.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the rating of the movie?", "id": "6b0ee7f2148f0437487bae7fdd041144", "answers": [{"text": "actually", "answer_start": 141}]}]}, {"context": "A lot of the parts are at night or in the dark.

The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about.  Morgan Freeman's character is also likable.  The other characters though are pretty bland.Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning.  There is not much action in this movie either.  The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it.  The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is.  However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film.", "qas": [{"question": "How do you like the story?", "id": "8548a963ba59135af46822612f6b2d77", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Epic, slick, and at times a little lost, OBLIVION is a well meaning scifi flick that takes too many wrong turns telling it's tale.Part MATRIX, part TOTAL RECALL, director Joseph Kosinski's tale of a future earth destroyed by alien attack (aided in part by their destruction of the moon).  In the very first minute of the film we're told in a voice over that while humanity won the war (by using nukes), the planet is now a barely recognizable radioactive wasteland.  The few people left are essentially mechanics for huge water processing plants meant to help reestablish humanity on the moon Titan.Tom Cruise's character is plagued by strange dreams of earth before the invasion - an earth he never saw.  These dreams are apparently brought on by the mind wipe he must go through to ensure that if captured by aliens, he can reveal no vital information.  Otherwise he seems content in fixing battle robots meant to destroy the few remaining alien stragglers and having loveless sex with his outpost partner.So much of this film's strategy is based on a slow reveal of a great secret.  Without getting in to details, it's a form of storytelling I've been been overly fond of - the flashback.  While it basically works (there's no doubt that all's not as it should be, right from the start), I can't help but wonder what might have been if this film was told as a linear narrative.And that's because Cruise is never really able to emotionally attach to anything or anyone in the movie, despite a mighty effort to do so.  The story is told in such a disjointed way that one spends more time trying to figure out what the mystery is as opposed to really caring what happens to the people in the story.Now if the script were more witty in it's dialogue or if the music was better, perhaps this style of film making would have worked better.  But the script is as plain a white bread - absolutely bland and perfunctory.  The music is worse - while electronic band M83 (Anthony Gonzalez & Joseph Trapanese) strive for something grand & epic, it comes off a bland version of Daft Punk's TRON: LEGACY score.  That's ironic as Kosinski also directed that otherwise very bland film.  OBLIVION absolutely screams out for a classical score like John Barry might have done, or something as far out and passionate as Vangelis, but instead is as generic as you're likely to hear in a major movie.Put simply, there's very little heart or soul in this film.  The effects are clean, crisp, and largely excellent, and the acting - while not stellar - is certainly good enough.  As are the sets, costumes and the like.  In the end Kosinski seemed far too occupied with the twists of the road as opposed to why he's on it in the first place.  That coupled with bland lines and music really helps limit what could have been a much more thrilling film.  One other huge negative - there's really only about an hour's worth of story here (at least as Kosinski tells it), yet OBLIVION is over two hours long, and that is the kiss of death for me.BOTTOM LINE:  3 \"They blew up the moon in VAMPIRELAND too!\" stars out of 5", "qas": [{"question": "How is the quality of soundtrack?", "id": "59308ba98006726f60f9087b2534ef56", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "this hauntingly beautiful movie, is a great piece of motion picture history.

While the similarities between Oblivion and Top Gun end at the aforementioned, there is no question that \"Maverick\" has all the right moves to portray galactic mechanic, Jack Harper in the most visually dazzling film of the year so far.Oblivion opens in 2077 after an alien threat has left Earth a barren wasteland fit only for extracting a few vital resources before humanity abandons the planet altogether to start a new existence on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cruise's Harper is a glorified serviceman who supervises and repairs the various resource-extraction devices along with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). As the two near the completion of their jobs on Earth, Harper begins having visions of his life prior to the mandatory memory-wipe that is required for service-workers. These visions lead him on a chain of events that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his life.Director Joseph Kosinski creates a vividly rich and nuanced futuristic environment where much of the technology feels like what truly is on the horizon. Kosinski directed 2010's under-rated visual spectacle, Tron Legacy, and it is apparent that he has his finger on the pulse of crisp, sci-fi style. Narrative-wise, Oblivion is a much more complex story than is likely expected. The complexities do provide some depth to the film and force the audience to pay close attention; however, the juxtaposition between the style and the narrative is not smooth. Occasionally, the film is forced into a lull as it tries to tie up its intricate plot points without sacrificing its visual pageantry. This is most apparent in the scenes that develop the sub-plot involving a human resistance leader named Beech (Morgan Freeman) and a mysterious NASA survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko).Oblivion's chief attributes are clearly its visual elements. Freeman and Kurylenko's characters are thinly developed and the actors are mostly unremarkable. However, it is becoming more and more apparent that any film that features Morgan Freeman in any role is most likely not a bad movie. Thematically, the film is successful at developing some intriguing ideas about discovery and purpose. The film acts as a subtle homage to familiar films like Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even Wall-E. Speaking of familiar, the score is oddly reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films. This is simply an observation, but having Morgan Freeman in the film as well certainly makes one wonder if this is some form of statement. Regardless, while some will no doubt be puzzled or dissatisfied with the conclusion, Oblivion mostly works as an epic and visually alluring entry into the science-fiction canon. B+On a side note, seeing the film in IMAX or an XTREME screen is recommended as the film has so much to offer visually. Oblivion is rated PG-13 and runs 125 minutes.", "qas": [{"question": "How is style?", "id": "6307e056e01fe978b72974c15d8dfb87", "answers": [{"text": "the style and the narrative is not smooth", "answer_start": 1618}]}]}, {"context": "I originally watched this because my husband forced me to, and turned out to really like it.

I don't often hand out praise. This movie was enjoyable to watch a dozen times when I received it and is highly recommended. An excellent cast although there was no chemistry with the actress who played Julia. Olga was not right for the part. She lacked the on screen presence and appeal and simply did not mesh with Cruise on screen. It wasn't any lack of acting. They simply lacked the chemistry needed for the role she played. They needed someone who stands out in a crowd and has sincerity in their eyes. I also think once the background story was known... it should have emphasized the fact that their marriage was kept secret from their crew and aerospace command center at the time which is why she wore the ring around her neck. It also should have included the fact that Vika had interests in him at the beginning and did not know about his marriage. Those two issues were not made clear.I was delighted that there was no blood and gore for a change other than a stain on a shirt. So thank you to the director, writer and producers for not subjecting the audience to violent gore.This was clearly the best set design I have ever seen when it came to the sky house. I found their front projection quite effective and visually stunning for both the audience and cast.The story had some wonderful new ideas... and it might have been nice to have seen some scenes of the thousands who came to attack 50 years earlier.This movie did have a unique story. A wonderful clean, futuristic design of architecture and high-tech devices. The intent to bring Sci-Fi back out into the sunlight is a concept I agree with. Over the years it had become dark and dirty and violent which is a turn off and most of us are sick and tired of those other grungy sci-fi's. While this did have some drone battle scenes (which were a bit long for my taste... but that's what fast forward is for) but some of the most important scenes were cut in favor of useless, prolonged drone battles inside a power plant and unnecessary CGI expense. Battle scenes are boring and monotonous & the audience is quite tired of them.Hasn't anyone noticed that the blockbuster hit movies all had good personal stories, limited battle scenes and no dark, dank or grungy... hit movies like Independence Day. This movie is also one of the best movies in recent years.In general it is the depth of the story, the characters & interaction, the cast and visual technologies which are important. Movies need the audience to invest their emotions. This movie aced the technology and clean futuristic architecture. The relationship with Vika was quite unique. She did a superb job of acting and nearly stole the entire film. The cast was excellent. The designs were beautiful as was the concept. I thought the writers approach to selling the story was a refreshing change from their usual antiquated script formats. I'm amazed it worked. I think more should have been done with Tet and we are more interested in seeing additional scenes of the condition of the cities and survivors survival attempts (like the grain crop concept in The Host) than barraging us with battles. This movie was very sparing about that so it was appreciated. Only 2 significant battle scenes which were fast forwarded through.The 3 most glaring errors were the deleting of the archives scene where Morgan showed him the book of his career. In fact, there should have been more scenes of the archives and more on what they had salvaged. The second was a simple blunder in the script dialogue. Vika told Sally that she needed a drone to scout grid 17 and Sally responds that she is sending a drone to grid 22. Clearly... Sally should have sent the drone to grid 17. Grid 22 wasn't even mentioned in the conversation. Someone should have caught that either on editing or at least when prescreening the movie without talking through it... and someone might have heard the mistake. It was pretty glaring. And finally, to hear Morgan talking about waves and bedrock in Chicago was a bit ridiculous. While New York and San Francisco are on bedrock and next to an ocean for tidal waves... Chicago is not on bedrock as far as I know... I've drilled in all three areas... and certainly would not be subject to Tsunami's from the great lakes. Some wave action perhaps... but would not bury Chicago... so that was the third glaring error.It was also obvious that Sally wasn't quite right in the first few minutes with the constant asking about being an \"effective team\". Her Texas accent was also waaay overdone. Plus, I would have waited a few minutes and established the future before doing the dream sequence rather than opening the movie with it. There also should have been more lighting in the lower level workshop. Most workshops are brightly lit. His should have been no different in that respect. But the set for their house was fabulous. I'd like to see all Sci-Fi's use projection screens like that.Unlike some people who judge actors on their personal lives, those issues are of no interest and should not be an issue in regard to the success of a movie. I only care how they do on screen and I must say they were all terrific with the chemistry exception I noted.However... we could have done without the cigar and the goggles on Morgan Freeman. It was not only ridiculous that he would still have access to Cigars after 50 years considering the planet was a wasteland... but it is about time to stop pushing tobacco products on our films. It is a gross affront to the audience especially when it has been banned in practically every building in the country... so what makes these filmmakers think we want to see some nasty cigar... especially Sci-Fi fans who usually have backgrounds in science, technology or engineering. Most of us know better than to smoke and don't enjoy watching it either. Prometheus did the same thing. It was offensive both times. Find a technology company to finance your sci-fi films. Microsoft or Sony or Toshiba, Apple or Verizon. Not tobacco companies. They should know that watching someone smoke only repulses people these days. It doesn't work like it did in the 40's. It does not make anyone want to smoke unless they are already addicted.We probably could have done without the scene of the 3 drones in that dark, dripping, dingy power plant. I hope the Director and producers realize you exposed your crew and cast to dangerous PCB's and lead and sulfuric acid left behind in that abandoned plant you chose to film in. It can't be cleaned from the concrete floors. It seeps into the concrete floors and then rained down all over the cast and crew during filming. That particular dark, grungy site  also contradicted your intention to bring Sci-Fi back in to the sunlight.I find it disturbing when the directors expose the cast and crew to hazardous and unpleasant conditions. What purpose did it serve to place that poor girl in a tank top in Iceland where she was freezing? It certainly didn't add to her appeal. And why would you allow your high dollar star to become injured? That knee or neck injury could affect him for the rest of his life. It was clear he was having great pain and difficulty walking on it during the library scene. The audience does  not require nor appreciate the actors being injured or subjected to miserable conditions. I think any directors who do this should be banned for life from working on any more films, regardless of how well the movie may have done. Injuring an actor is inexcusable and unnecessary. Their contracts should spell out that they are prohibited from engaging in precarious behavior which may result in injuries. In addition to the damage to the actor, it could bankrupt a studio and infuriate an audience over the gross inconsideration shown to the cast. NO movie is important enough to cause harm or discomfort to a cast... such as filming in 100 degree weather as Star Trek Generations did to 3 star actors who could have died from heat related heart attacks as did Clark Gable and John Candy under similar conditions... or like this movie... putting their actors on top of a mountain Cliff in Iceland. Cruise is over 51 and shouldn't be running up cliffs and high sand dunes if he doesn't want to end up like Ritter, Gable and Candy... despite how energetic he feels. Guys who go overboard to overdo everything to prove their youth are prime candidates for fatal heart attacks.If you want Iceland... then green-screen it. We won't know the difference. Many of us have a long memory about damage to actors and stunt crews... Harry Potter's stunt double who is paralyzed. Vic Morrow and 2 children dead from a helicopter crash on set. Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet age 12 caused a life long back injury. William Shatner with Tinnitus. Ida Lupino, Wayne and crew from cancers after filming in fallout Nevada. I didn't look up any of these incidents. We do remember these incidents and it definitely needs to stop.I'm willing to bet Cruise will require arthroscopic surgery on that knee in 5 years and will end up with stenosis from the neck hyperextension in less than 10 years just from that one library scene in this movie.

But let's face it, how many films are so fresh and new that they delve into uncharted territory?  In any case, don't care.  Whether it's a drama, a comedy, a horror movie or even a romantic comedy, it's how well it is delivered that counts.  And this film delivers.Like \"TRON\" the film is visually arresting.  Seen on a big screen, the sets are huge but sparse, drawing the audience in.  Set in a war-ravaged Earth of 2077 devoid of humans, all of whom have resettled on a moon of Saturn, only Jack (terrific Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain.  They are partners (both romantic and professionally) whose mission is to watch over the drones that patrol the area for a smattering of \"Scavs\" who were the defeated invaders.  While Earth won the war, they lost the planet which continues to be harvested for water and other ecological matter.Jack is the investigative repair man who goes out alone.  Victoria never leaves their high control point and guides him using sophisticated tracking technology.  While investigating an unusual radio beacon, Jack witnesses a spacecraft crash.  One of the survivors is a human flight officer named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who he has occasionally dreamed about.  Both Jack and Vic have had their memories \"washed\" in order to eliminate thoughts of the terrible war.  Uh, sure.  What Jack believes to be \"Scavs\" turns out to be Beech (Morgan Freeman) and his collection of survivors.  The truth is out there and Jack must find it, and does with the help of Julia.Like \"TRON,\"  \"Oblivion\" is beautiful to watch and has a great soundtrack, mostly provided by French electronic band, M83.  Yes, \"Oblivion\" borrows from a list of movies too long to mention, but for those of us who salivate for science fiction films with a breath of intelligence, this one does the trick.BLU RAY REVIEW: In this subsequent viewing of this terrific sci-fi film, I was able to tie up a few elements I didn't quite understand the first time around.  I would also have to say this is one of the best looking movies of any genre I've seen.  The special features on the Blu ray disc add some clarity on how and why the filmmakers went for a certain look and it truly comes across beautifully.The other thing I had missed the first time around was the romantic relationship between Jack and Victoria and subsequently Julia.  It was there but just wasn't a point of focus.  By \"there,\" I mean it wasn't explicit, either by subdued actions or love making.  Regarding the later, the most interesting coupling occurs in the swimming pool.  It seems clear that Jack's relationship with Victoria seems forced or maybe expected is a better word.  He does all the right things that husbands and wives do, but it seems like a matter of routine more than true love.  Watch Cruise's face during those intimate close ups.  Something is wrong.  Of course those memory flashbacks of Julia don't help.  When Jack finally does find Julia, it all clicks.  Not quickly, but you can see in Jack's reactions, he loves this woman.  But why?  In the end, he shows how much he loves her.  \"Oblivion\" is also a beautiful love story.There is nothing like watching a beautiful movie like this on the big screen, but this Blu Ray transfer comes damn close.  The 1080p transfer is spectacular in every respect and certainly will be a show off piece to a good system.  It comes in the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and does a great job replicating the original film.  The dystopian world is now essentially uninhabited and the stark whites and various shades contrast nicely with deep dark blacks.  When the story moves underground, shadows and shadings of grey prevail.  But even when Jack retreats to his cabin in the wilderness, we get beautiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor.  I could see no encoding issues.  The contrast and detail are excellent.Equaling the visuals is a magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  Again put this one on your demo list.  If you have sub-woofers, they will get a workout as the rumbles coming from many sources including gunfire, rockets and explosions.  The surrounds are constantly in play with movement from side to side, back and forth as the drone ships fly around.  Dialog is clear and well presented.  Ambient noise is ever present as well.Extras include an excellent commentary track by Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski, a 48 minute \"making of\" documentary, some deleted scenes and get this, an isolated musical score by M83 in Dolby TruHD 5.1 (24 bit, 96kHz).

The moon was destroyed, although we don't know how, and that was the beginning of the end for Earth.Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Jack Reacher) plays an astronaut Jack who is assigned to repair and maintenance of drones that protect a machine that basically turns our seawater into energy for a the population of earth which has `apparently' moved to a moon of Saturn after an alien attack. It was an alien war in which Earth apparently won or so the audience is lead to believe.Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Dolphin Tale) plays an unsuspecting prospector of many who holds the truth of what really happened. His command of the scenes he is in makes you believe what he says, although unbelievable at first, it could be true. I can't give away the reasons or what he represents without spoiling the film for you, but - spoiler - everything is not what it seems to be.Two really good, sedate but powerful performances come from Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace, Hitman) as a mission specialist with a history with Cruise's character that will defiantely surprise you - and the second performance comes from Andrea Riseborough (Shadow Dancer, Resistance) playing the woman in Cruise's life who along with maintaining the technical aspects of communication is also his partner in life.The ships, probes, drones, vehicles and even the finale with the surprise orbiting station is visually impressive. The action sequences are intense and by the second hour it seems like a nonstop action/adventure film filled near misses and explosions.\"Oblivion\" has an interesting and dynamic musical score to accompany the visuals by M.8.3., a pop/rock group with composer Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese that really captures the `feel' of what is going on. The movie really begins to take flight really in the second half of the film but it does have the widescreen epic motif that allows the audience to ask questions and just about almost all of them are answered.

Christopher Nolan has also done an excellent job in helping revive the Superman saga.

The guy risks his life to save Jenny Olson (yeah, Jimmy's had a sex change), and later on she rejects his invitation to court side basketball tickets (never mind HOW Metropolis got back on its feet soon enough to HAVE basketball games. Remember 9/11? Two building were blown up and Broadway was closed for weeks. Half the city is destroyed and its like nothing at all happened). This is quite possibly the worst version of Superman I've seen so far, and I'm including Superman IV: The Quest of Peace! God, this movie is serious. There's not one bit of joy in it.

Guillermo del Toro directs two types of films, high concept art house type films usually in Spanish(Pans Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone), and action blockbusters with high budgets and heavy use of CGI (Blade II, Hellboy, and its sequel), this film falls into the latter category, which anyone who has seen the preview can surmise. The dialogue feels canned and cheesy one-liners fly from the mouths of nearly every actor in this film. The plot is as thin and predictable as it is farfetched, but this could all have been guessed from watching the trailer as well.A few actors who weren't featured in the trailers make appearances, I won't spoil who they are or what roles they play, but they are a pleasant surprise as they provide some relief from a story that is a little too serious at times. While no one makes Oscar worthy performance, the acting is perfectly acceptable and on par with most action movies, although some of the actors are not the greatest at American English accents in spite of their efforts. I suppose this can be explained away as the film is set in the future, and who knows what American English will sound like then (I'll bet it will sound quite a lot like mine, my parents', and my grandparents' accents).While the plot, dialogue, and acting are on par with every other action blockbuster of the past decade, I must admit that the CGI and visuals are some of the most realistic I have seen. The visual effects are stunning. Thanks to the amazing work of Industrial Light and Magic there is not a single scene in the film where I felt as though the CGI was blatantly apparent beyond the fact that such things do not exist, something I wish I could say about the recently released Man of Steel. The 3d is also quite good, sometimes 3d is a little overdone and it feels unnatural and hurts your eyes, this is fortunately not the case with this film. This 3d experience is easily on par with Avatar, probably the result of a film which was intended for 3d from the get go. All in all this film is an entertaining escape, albeit one that may not be too surprising or particularly memorable.", "qas": [{"question": "How is it the story line?", "id": "570ae05ed376c857df37e030c939f885", "answers": [{"text": "a story that is a little too serious", "answer_start": 936}, {"text": "this film falls into the latter category, which anyone who has seen the preview can surmise.

It is, with one small exception, the perfect summer film.Every summer, the studios overhype their biggest bets and get the movie going public excited about films that will probably end up letting us down. From the sequel with too many special effects and little or no character development to the endless big screen adaptations of super heroes and countless attempts to scare us with gory humor or gross out comedy, these films are usually missing at least one element to make them something special, something to care about, something to remember. Usually, that element is balance; special effects are good but need to be balanced by character development and narrative.But \"Pacific Rim\" isn't a sequel, has great special effects, great action, a believable and interesting backstory and significant character development. If there is anything to criticize, it does use a tried and true formulaic set-up for the ending. But the rest of the film is so good; this can and should be overlooked.The film opens a few years into the Kaiju War. A few years back, giant space aliens begin to invade Earth through a rift in the Pacific Rim. These monsters begin to attack our cities, killing untold millions of people and causing catastrophic destruction. Governments join forces and form an alliance combining resources to figure out how to battle these monsters. The solution? Jaegers - large robots manned by two pilots who are connected via a mind probe operating the large robots as a team. The Jaegers are dispatched from a number of stations located around the Pacific. And the program works until the Kaiju start to learn. And start to win again. Flash forward a few years, and the program is going to be shut down. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the leader of the program recruits a number of the best Jaeger pilots to lead one last ditch attempt to get rid of them once and for all. He brings everyone to Hong Kong, the last operational station, to join Dr. Geiszler (Charlie Day, TV's \"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\"), who believes he can do a mind meld with one of the Kaiju, Gottlieb (Burn Gorman, TV's \"Torchwood\"), the crazy inventor who comes up with the equipment they need and Ops Tendo Choi (Clifton Collins, Jr.) who is the man in charge of guiding the missions. One of the pilots Stacker brings to Hong Kong is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) who has been living incognito for a few years, since his last mission failed and his co-pilot died. When the team is assembled, they begin to realize certain things about the Kaiju and come up with a plan to end the invasion once and for all. Stacker is forced to team Raleigh with a trainee, Mako (Rinko Kinkuchi), his own prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but watches them very closely to see if they can handle the assignment.I admire Guillermo Del Toro. He was clearly influenced by fantasy and sci-fi films as a kid and has devoted his career as a filmmaker to create more films to add to this genre. This early influence seems to drive him to make more interesting and unusual films, films that test the boundaries of these genres. As a director, he brings an incredible depth of detail to the composition of his films, layering images and ideas, creating something for the viewer to feast on, much like the creatures feast on their victims in many of his films. He has also used his newfound clout in Hollywood to produce and `Present\" a number of projects from other filmmakers - his hand has been in everything from animation to genre horror. While these films are more interesting and unusual because of his involvement, the films he directs are the special ones, the ones to keep an eye out for.In \"Pacific Rim\", he and his team create an incredible backstory, smartly placing us in the middle of the action. Brief voiceover from Raleigh gets us up to speed and then we join him on a battle, watching the robots and monsters battle in the waters off Alaska. But that isn't enough for Del Toro - as each character is introduced, we learn something about them, their history, even if it is just from a seemingly offhand comment. Because we know more about these characters, they seem more real and we invest more emotion in them, making the outcome of their journey all the more important to us.I have to say that with all of the CGI flooding the multiplex, I was worried that \"Pacific Rim\" would be another example of a director who runs rampant with his toy box, using every toy at his disposal whether it makes sense or not. And that is exactly what Del Toro does, but he does it in a way that works brilliantly. The key difference between Del Toro and most other directors is that the CGI is used to tell the story, not to cover up the holes in the narrative. In the \"Transformers\" films, the robots crash into buildings and streets and construction, causing destruction but surrounding areas are remarkably intact. In \"Pacific Rim\", these robots and aliens are huge, so when they move through specific types of areas, their movements cause destruction, breaking windows and walls simply because the huge creatures are moving through the area. It is a big difference and adds to the realism of the story.The battles between the Kaiju and the Jaegers are impressively staged. The action is pretty thrilling and easy to follow, which isn't often said when watching action staged using CGI. Generally, a `real' element is needed to ground the action - frequently actors on the ground running from the large CGI beasts - and make it seem real. In \"Pacific Rim\", the CGI is so good everything already seems real so this extra distraction isn't needed. What is even more impressive is most of the battles take place at night, in the rain, or both, so the palette is darker. These scenes are more interesting and better staged than scenes in the \"Transformers\" films, most of which take place in broad daylight. Del Toro isn't afraid to step back and use a wide shot occasionally, allowing us to view the entire scene. Michael Bay keeps his compositions much more confined, which limits them and makes the film feel less grand.The actors are all good and create viable characters - It helps that they all have a history to work with making them more interesting. Hunnam, cast in a role that was reportedly written for him, brings a lot of complexity to the role of Raleigh. Living off the grid for a while, it takes him some time to get back up to speed, to refill his hero batteries. Idris Elba is very good as the leader of this group. When the heads of the nations involved in the program tell him the Jaeger's will soon be replaced by a giant \"Kaiju-proof\" wall, you can see the disbelief, pain and disappointment in his eyes. His relationship with Mako also helps to create a lot of empathy for both, making us as invested in his character as we are in Rinku Kinkuchi. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman provide some much needed comic relief. And it wouldn't be a Del Toro film without Ron Pearlman, who plays a black market dealer specializing in Kaiju parts. His role is also funny, adding some much needed laughs.My one complaint is that the last act is pretty predictable. Del Toro places all of the characters in very familiar places and you can easily see what will happen and when. In the hands of a less experienced or less interesting director, this would be a problem. But Del Toro has already created such a unique landscape filled with interesting characters when this happens that it is easier to overlook.I enjoyed the first \"Transformers\" film, but \"Pacific Rim\" is heads and shoulders above that level. Which shouldn't really be a surprise. Michael Bay is no Guillermo Del Toro.Come on, how could any film with giant robots battling giant aliens be bad? It's like watching a new, good version of a Godzilla-on-steroids film.", "qas": [{"question": "What is talent?", "id": "2ab8ad83e1383fec853a5a8040b5da9b", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "I really enjoyed the special effects in this movie!

I decided to read some reviews on amazon. While the reviews are a mixed bag of positives and negatives. I kept reading about \"Guillermo del Toro\" who I believe directed the film but I couldn't match the name with a face. then I read that this movie is made by the same person who made Hellboy into a movie. Let me start off by saying, Hellboy was not something I liked at all, nor any of his other movies. For Example, the story, characters and feel of Hellboy and other movies by Del Torro are in my mind, extremely cheesy, and often annoying. This movie seemed to have a bit of a different feel, and after reading more on what the 3D version is like, I decided it would be worth buying to add to my ever expanding collection of bluray 3D movies. I watched this movie last night, without high expectations. I popped in the movie, grabbed a soda and some munchies, and watched with amazement. The 3D effects and CGI are truly top notch. There were parts when I thought to myself, \"now this is what 3D movies need to look like\", IMHO.  With the sound cranked up, feeding my ears with awesome sounds and my eyes gazing into the amazing CGI and incredibly dazzling 3D graphics, I was very happy and excited.When the main actor of this movie came on, I was a little put off by seeing some \"overacting\" that was more annoying than enticing. Throughout the movie, there are parts where I wished they would just cut out the story, and just get to the cool parts where the CGI and 3D blend to make an extraordinary visual explosion to the eyes and mind. The actor who played Hellboy is in this movie, who is another person I cannot Stand watching - Ron Perlman. There are the good guys, who have to battle these incredibly large monsters coming from another dimension. The great part about the monsters is, they don't cut anything out as far as the full presentation of the monsters body, size and overall look. It's all there which is too cool. Often in movies like Godzilla, King Kong, and even the recent Hobbit movie where there is no actual scene that shows Smaug the dragon in his entirety, this movie does not leave you wishing you could see more of what these monsters look like. They don't make you use your imagination to fill in the blanks. In 3D, these monsters are popping out at you and look nothing short of incredible. The monsters are taken on by the good guys that use somewhat matching size Mech machines as shown on the cover of this movie. The Mech Machines are also dazzling to watch, and look incredible while combating against these evil monsters.Looking at this movie from all perspectives, there were many things that make this movie worth watching again and again. This movie is so beautiful and the 3D is so good, that it's tough to rival compared to any other 3D movie I have seen at home (vs. in the theater or via IMAX). The 3D effects and stunning visuals alone makes me happy I purchased this film. The story itself, is not bad either. Is it great? Absolutely not, but trust me, it could have been a lot worse. It's got a good premises and although far fetched, it's exciting and makes you think a bit, which is what tells me a movie is good (from a story standpoint). The acting? Well, that depends on one's definition of acting. Most of it was tough to watch and you want to laugh at some scenes because the acting is way overplayed and comes off as lame for the most part. Acting aside, the actual actors in this movie are so-so. Del Torro makes his appearance, which to me was a real downer since I can't stand watching this guy. The main characters otherwise are not going to win any awards for this movie, I can asure you. This is an action movie, and there is no doubt that this is truly action packed. Some reviews state that the movie drags on, but I didn't feel that. It wasn't too short, and it is by no means a long film like any of the lord of the rings movies. There is not enough story and detail with characters and overall environment to support anymore time than the actual film dispays. There could have been some scenes that were shortened to keep the action scenes a little tighter, but overall the length of the film is appropriate in my opinion.This movie, by far, will not be for everyone. My wife didn't watch this, but I can guarantee she would have rolled her eyes at the end of this film and would say \"wow, that was really lame\". Other reviews on this site for this movie have pegged it down pretty well. If you like old style Japanese movies with Godzilla and King Kong where there is mass destruction with every swing the bad guys take, then this is for you. If you like action packed films with fairly poor acting (almost comparable to B films with poor acting but decent story - for example movies on the Sci-Fy channel) then you will probably enjoy this. The major different between budget films and this is solely based on the amount of work that's gone into the CGI and overall effects. They are truly, truly amazing. This film could have been so much more, but for what it's worth, its a good flick for the action junkies, the nerds, the manga and Japanese Monster lovers, and for anyone with an open mind that can tune out the negatives, and see the movie for what is really is - an action packed, visually stunning and phenomenal 3D flick that will not leave you disappointed. If I were to see this in the standard Blu-ray edition, I think I would rate this somewhere between 2 & 3 stars. But, I got the 3D version, and am very happy I did. For this version, I would rate this a high 3 or low 4. Many will like this, however, many will find it an absolute joke. The question is, where will/do you stand????

Malekith attempts to unleash the Aether during the Convergence: a cosmic event where all the realms line up in a syzygy conjunction- all in a row- joining them together.  Defeated by Bor, Odin's father, Malekith retreats with his core forces and goes into suspended animation.  Unable to destroy the Aether, Bor orders it buried somewhere far beyond anyone's reach.  Until now...Meanwhile, Thor is still cleaning up the mess Loki made of things.  The Nine Worlds are battling vestiges of chaos, wars raging across them all.  Things finally get under control just as a new convergence is beginning; the walls between the dimensions become unstable, causing spatial rifts on Earth.  Jane Foster and her friend Darcy, discover one such portal, which draws Jane in to where she discovers where the Aether is hidden and is contaminated by it, which awakens Malekith.  Thor brings Jane to Asgard to try to help her, rekindling their romance.  The Dark Elves' science allows them to hide from even Heimdall's gaze, and they strike at Asgard looking for Jane.  Loki, ever unrepentant, is languishing in the dungeon when Malekith attacks, and even aids the cause a little, which he soon comes to regret.  Now facing complete annihilation, Thor and his allies form a desperate plan to confront Malekith and destroy the Aether- and they'll need Loki's help to do it.**END SPOILERS**This movie was a lot of fun, and in almost every way superior to the first.  The story's tone was darker and much more serious; even though it relied a lot on sci-fi tropes it worked well.  The Dark Elves are more along the lines of super-science than a science/sorcery blend- they're basically a bunch of conquering aliens that for a second or two you'd almost think were Klingons or something from their technology designs.In our age of 3D filming, there's lots of stuff getting tossed around, large objects being destroyed and things flying all over the place just for the heck of it sometimes, but it doesn't distract too much. In fact, the action is pretty good; there's some excellent fight scenes and nearly every character gets some action in- even Frigga gets to mix it up a little, much to everyone's delight!The character development is also stellar.  Nearly everyone gets time to shine, especially Loki (natch), and some of his scenes are the best in the flick- the ones when he receives some rather bad news and when he's accompanying Thor on their quest are standouts.  There's a moment of tragedy which binds he and Thor together and helps to secure Loki's aid against the Dark Elves, and it's a tough one but it serves the story well.  Some of the dialogue is pretty cheesy at times, but that's ok.  The humor is also good; not overwhelming things but just enough in the right places to keep things flowing.  And there's a few references to the Marvel Universe, which made for some excellent touches.Thor: The Dark World is in lots of ways the movie the first one should've been.  It builds upon the franchise's mythology, and takes a couple of turns you won't really expect.  And it's all to the good.

I finally got a chance to see it last month and I was not disappointed.  This is easily of of the best films of the year with probably the best cast of the year.  This film is based of the best selling book of the same name and David O' Russell captured it perfectly.  The film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano.  His mom has just picked him up from a mental institution in which he has spent the last eight months for assaulting his wife's lover.  Even though the doctors feel as though he needs more time there, Pat leaves and head home...well at least his parent's home.  Pat wants to get his life back on track and his wife back by working out, reading his wife's summer reading list for her class and work on his \"issues\" even though he believes he does not need his medication in order to do it.  This is going to be easier said then done because right after his fight with his wife's lover, she put a restraining order on him, she moved away and he lost his teaching job.  After being invited to dinner by his friend, Ronnie, he meets Tiffany.  A woman who has just lost her policeman husband and has issues of their own.  Even though things are rocky between to two of them at first, they eventually form an odd friendship.  When Pat learns that Tiffany has a personal connection to his wife, Nikki, the two of them strike up a deal.  If he agrees to be her partner at an upcoming dance competition, she'll agree to supply his wife a letter from him.  At first glance, this might seem like a crazy idea for a romantic comedy drama and that there is no way in hell that this could work.  Having said that, this film amazingly works.  Its funny, heartfelt, insightful and inspiring.  What makes it so good is that all of these people are not caricatures of people.  They are real people with real hopes, dreams and issues.  To me, the best characters are the ones we can identify with and you can do that to a certain extent with each of these characters.  David O' Russell directed and wrote this film.  I give him credit for being able to make a great film that included mental illness, the Philadelphia Eagles, comedy and drama all in the same film.  He got nominated for a Best Director Oscar for The Fighter (another amazing film) and should receive writing and directing nominations at the next Oscars.  Jennifer Lawrence is truly one of the best and brightest stars today.  Even though her character is suppose to be older and she was only 21 at the time of filming, she is completely believable as a damage woman looking for a silver lining in her life.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for Winter's Bone, gave another acclaimed performance in the huge blockbuster The Hunger Games and I see another Oscar nomination for this film.  She deserved the first one and she really deserves another one.  Robert De Niro is back ladies and gentleman.  After a few years of films and performances that were not that well received, he comes back with a vengeance in this film as Pat's OCD father.  Add to his list another Oscar nomination for this performance.  He walks the line of concerned father and superstitious Eagles fan beautifully.  Jacki Weaver was great as his concerned mom.  She earned a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for Animal Kingdom as the mom from hell and she does a complete 180 as as woman that wants to see her son get back on her feet.  I think she should get another one for this film.  Chris Tucker was in the film as Pat's friend from the mental institution and all I have to say is welcome back Chris.  We know him mostly as loud mouth characters from Money Talks, Friday and the hugely successful Rush Hour franchise.  He really tones it down to be a more realistic character and he is still funny as hell.  I don't know it it will happen but he should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination because he was truly memorable in this film.  The rest of the supporting cast is great as well in their roles.  I reserve the highest acclaim for Bradley Cooper.  We mostly know him from comedies like Wedding Crashers, Hit and Run, and the highly acclaimed (and funny as hell) The Hangover.  Last year, he made a film called Limitless that showed that he does have some range.  His performance from Silver Linings Playbook takes that to another level.  This is not only his best performance to date but this is also one of the best performances of the year.  He was extremely believable as Pat.  Even though his character was highly troubled, we saw a guy that was really trying to get his act together.  You see Pat at his best and you see him at his worst.  You feel for him from the moment he leaves the mental hospital to the moment the film ends.  You really want him to get his silver lining.  If he is not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, it will be a travesty.  This is easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best films ever made.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the incredible chemistry?", "id": "de4920363d62ab9e4032db14f7bf570a", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B008PEHZXI", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This series is fun to watch and enjoyable.

Lets talk about the movie itself. (MAYBE SOME SPOILERS). I am a die hard fan of all the movies and shows including TOS. The movie was great entertainment, great special affects, all actors did a well as expected job.Story direction: I am a little disappointed in the direction this story went or is going. I know there are dozens of storys to be used even from TOS that were never made into shows. Why remake a whole movie? Especially one that was probably the most successful? Its one thing to tweak threads from different storys but to rearrange and retell an entire movie and story line....I really expected more from Abrams. The movie was extremely fast paced and barely any time for any substantial dialogue. It teetered on the edge of lacking substance. The growing bond with Kirk/Spock/McCoy. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but it seems they tried to pack so much into the movie it was busting at the seams with any and every tid bit of information of TOS history, including using old lines (some re-worded) from the original series or previous movies from the old cast. I think its ok to resemble some lines etc but don't just throw them in there just to have them in there. I do like the way Marcus and Nurse Chapel were brought into the story, very clever.Characters: Dr. McCoy--What was bothersome were the amount of cliched analogy's they had Dr. McCoy spouting off. At one point in the movie Spock said, \"enough already with the analogy's\". That was amusing but it was no longer amusing when they had McCoy continue doing these analogy's, in fact I would say JJ Abrams was on the edge of \"SPOOFING\" the good doctor. McCoy had very little insightful or useful dialogue throughout the whole movie. That was disappointing. We all love McCoy's attitude and sarcasm with Kirk and Spock, but they really wore it to death with every one liner cliche they could pack in there. McCoy deserves better than that.Spock: Although Zachary Quinto does a great job with Spock, the Spock character it seems has been softened for lack of better words. And what about this fling he has with Uhura? Pryor story? Originally written? I don't know, but it makes Spock a bit of a pansy, instead of a level headed Vulcan always in control. And what about \"PON FAR\"? I guess that's out the window now? I'm just not buyng this fling with Uhura. This movie had moments where he was indecisive and unsure of himself. That's not the Spock we know from past, even the young Spock from past. True he was young and still learning to cope with his human side. But if he wasn't in control as a Vulcan should be then he probably wasn't ready for life in general much less being a Star Fleet officer.Uhura: Great job by the actress but they have her character very lax & emotional, its not complimentary of a StarFleet officer nor to the original Uhura character. Scotty, Chekov and Sulu all do well and their characters flow well in these new movies.Kirk: Chris Pine does as well as expected on Kirk. Maybe just a little bit too lax in his command. I realize this is young Kirk and he is learning who he is. But even a young Kirk would actually command more respect than an older Kirk who's been around the block.Kahn: This guy did OK job, but he lacked the strong screen presence even the older Kahn gave us. Obviously no one can match Ricardo Montalban but if you cant find someone with equally or more  powerful substance on the screen, then dont do it at all. Even Kahn's character deserved some one better.Bottom Line: The movie is entertaining and very watchable. Although it is a remake of an older one, they did change it up enough to keep you guessing. But it wasn't enough to cover my disappointment of trying to do the remake in the first place. I am concerned on where Abrams is going with these characters. My other concern is ending up with a bunch of remakes of movies from the 80\"s. These movies will stand the test of time, leave them alone. So far every single Star Trek Big Picture has been with an original story, even TNG movies never remade from an old old movie.The first Star Trek movie Abrams did offered us a great perspective of the whole crew and how they came to be, this movie although is entertaining, was not nearly as fresh and exciting as the previous one.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the flow of the plot?", "id": "299c2f241a84b21e0353e72452c49f01", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Just saw this is in theater and I thought it was awesome.

For one thing, the trailers looked great, promising a dark, action-packed film where the stakes were high and the threat was even higher. For another thing, it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it, a consistently good player, as well as a fine cast that included Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, and Peter Weller. The reviews were (mostly) positive, too. So I went and saw it. I had a good time.But I left the theatre with mixed feelings. When I was invited to see it a second time, I saw the film with renewed concentration. I weighed the good, and I weighed the bad. And the film was found wanting.But before you click that dislike button, hear me out. But be warned, there are spoilers below.First, lets see what I DID like:1. Benedict Cumberbatch is the boss! He makes every film he is in better, whether he's acting as a giant dragon or a fussy detective. He is up to par, as expected, in Into Darkness. He is definitely the high point of the film, even if his character has got some script issues.2. Another equally good antagonist is horror icon Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus. His scene-stealing ultra-bad-dude gets some great lines (\"You will run this bastard down\") and fun scenes. He reminds me of the film it could have been.3. Michael Giaccino. Wow! The J.J. Abrams staple has outdone himself with his score, which ranges from beautiful piano to pounding drums. The score in the London hospital scenes is incredibly brilliant.4. The action is great! And there's lots of it to behold. Love the mixes of martial arts!5. You know who else I liked? That little mute alien that travels around with Scotty. No kidding! Give that guy an Oscar!Now, for what I did NOT like:1. OK, lets start with the very beginning. I sat down in the darkened cinema, and the film began. Everything was blurry and out of focus. Aha! I forgot to put on my 3D glasses. I put them on my head. Everything was dark, blurry, and out of focus. Please tell me I am not the only one who thinks 3D is overrated. Like this review if you think 3D is overrated. Now, I completely understand 3D as a TOOL to tell stories. James Cameron used it brilliantly in Avatar, as did Scorsese in Hugo, Ang Lee in Life of Pi, and Peter Jackson in The Hobbit. Those films are only made BETTER because of it.But let me get this straight: 3D should not be put in for making money, to appeal to younger audiences, or as a joke. Superhero movies do not need to be in 3D. The Great Gatsby does not need to be in 3D. Neither does The Last Airbender, Alice in Wonderland, or The Jonas Brothers 3D Concert Video. Star Trek Into Darkness did not NEED to be in 3D.2. The opening salvo looked like it was being filmed by a hyper-caffeinated teenager with ADD. A person beside me muttered \"It looks like a video game.\" Indeed, with the bright colors, fake-looking 3D, lens flares, and out-of-focus shaky cam so shaky it would make Jason Bourne jealous, it did indeed remind one of a video game. But is that a bad thing?3. And here's my biggest problem with the film: the lack of emotion.Near the beginning of the movie, a Starfleet officer is blackmailed by Khan into blowing up the London Starfleet headquarters. We are supposed to feel sorry for this guy, we are almost TOLD to feel sorry for him (with lots of lingering shots on his sick daughter and saddened face), but we do not. The explosion itself is cold and distant, and not in a good way.Iron Man 3 also has a couple suicide bombings, and while it's not a perfect film, you actually feel for the characters. They appear human in our eyes, and the incident is all the more shocking because the stakes are that much higher.Not so in Into Darkness. Instead of feeling sorry for the characters, the audience instead is wondering how such a tiny ring makes such a ludicrously large explosion.Even worse, the explosion is never brought up again, except very briefly. We see no ordinary people affected by it, which makes it hard to feel for the characters, and worse, we don't feel that Khan is actually much of a villain either. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? That never comes about either.In another scene, Spock and Uhura talk about their feelings while flying in Klingon airspace. \"Are they really doing this right now?\" another person beside me asked. I knew what Abrams was trying to do. He was lulling us into a false sense of calm, just to pull a jump scare. And, on queue, it happened. Boom. Yawn. Did I mention that said action scene was AWESOME?There is one action scene where Chekov is sliding down the floor of the Enterprise screaming. I thought he was going to die. But he didn't. The action fell flat. If Chekov had died, who knows how brilliant this film could have been? In the original Star Trek franchise, Spock died. Sure, he was raised again, but at the cost of the Enterprise. To quote another critic, the first series weren't perfect, but at least they were daring. They raised the stakes.Kirk dies in Star Trek Into Darkness, but he is resurrected a few minutes later. Why didn't he stay dead, at least until the inevitable sequel? Think how brave that film could have been! Even when Admiral Pike dies we don't feel sad. It just felt like the mandatory killing off of *that* character to generate sympathy.4. The script. Now this is a time where we can all rally together and point fingers at someone: Damon Lindelof. The guy who ruined Lost, Cowboys and Aliens, Prometheus, and Star Trek Into Darkness. That guy is cinematic poison. It took a second viewing to see all the chinks in the armour. As I said before, Cumberbatch is phenomenal, but when he says \"You, you can't even break a rule, how can you be expected to break bone?\" the seriousness falls out of the story. Lindelof is trying too hard to give him cool lines. Then there's the question of the misogynistic, unnecessary, gratuitous, completely offensive changing scene with Alice Eve (is it just me or is her character somewhat unnecessary?). This got so many bad reviews that Lindelof had to issue an official apology via Twitter.There are a myriad of plotholes pointed out by other cinemaphiles. Some you notice and care about, some you don't.Namely, there's the little \"Khan's magic blood\" twist, which gave many reviewers the impression that Abrams did not know whether he wanted to distance himself from the first franchise and create something new, or follow in older footsteps. The film tries to \"homage\" older films, but only succeeds in making a mess....The result? Not a BAD film. No, not at all. Just a film that could have been so much greater. Did I hate Star Trek Into Darkness? I rather enjoyed it; it's not a bad film at all. It's a great action blockbuster. Abrams and Co. have created a film we can all enjoy, regardless of issues. In conclusion: Hov Trek Into Darkness is dun qu' tIv poH 'ej lathl QaQ movie, with op ay! Pardon my Klingon, it's never been a strong point.yIn nI' yISIQ 'ej yIchep.Live long and prosper, Abrams!", "qas": [{"question": "Does this movie have a lot of action?", "id": "1096b29e92a6a3f3470fbda4e57cce84", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "In Star Trek Into Darkness, his follow-up to 2009's blockbuster reimaginging of the Star Trek franchise, JJ Abrams delivers a visually spectacular and action-packed installment that's big on spectacle and a little forced on plot.The plot in its simplest form pits the crew of the Enterprise against a mysterious and vicious figure known as John Harrison, a former member of Starfleet who commits an act of terrorism against London and flees to a war-zone planet outside the neutral zone. Captain Kirk and his crew embark on a manhunt to capture Harrison with the hopes of exacting revenge and preventing further bloodshed.The film itself looks fantastic; Abrams is a true master of visuals and spectacle, both of which are on huge display here. The cityscapes, set pieces, and space effects, including travel and starships, are incredibly detailed and a wonder to behold.The cast, as in the previous film, are equally enjoyable to watch; Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have really nailed their respective characters in Kirk and Spock and have a lot more camaraderie this time around. The rest of the fantastic crew has returned for this installment as well, including Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, and Bruce Greenwood. As for the newcomers, Peter Weller is well cast in his role as Admiral Marcus, the man responsible for sending Kirk to catch Harrison. Alice Eve is also very good as Carol Marcus, reassigned science officer of the Enterprise and daughter of Admiral Marcus. The biggest newcomer to the film is that of the villain, played by the increasingly intriguing and engaging Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays his part extremely well and, for me, is one of the highlights of the film.Alas, if only the story could have been as strong as the visuals and cast. The plot, while entertaining as hell and lot of fun to watch, has quite a few holes that can simply be chalked up to sloppy writing. I'll keep this review spoiler-free but there were multiple instances I found myself scratching my head because of what was unfolding onscreen. While this didn't detract from the fun I had while watching the movie, I found myself thinking more and more about the problems with the script afterwards. Don't get me wrong; the film is an outstanding summer blockbuster that will hold its own in the Trek catalog, it just contains a few plot points that were either too convenient or too unexplained for my taste.Overall this is a really good follow-up in the rebooted Star Trek universe and has everything an summer popcorn-flick should. Though it does have some plot issues, I highly recommend this if you're a fan of action blockbusters, sci-fi, or the 2009 reboot.", "qas": [{"question": "Is the plot in the film interesting to watch?", "id": "ccbe894ad39523f03a25bcf9c2401f5c", "answers": [{"text": "JJ Abrams delivers a visually spectacular and action", "answer_start": 105}]}, {"question": "How is the direct?", "id": "0d41e028815b4e2dcde904f201bb0b4b", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Any movie with a couple of hours of Chris Pine and especially Alice Eve is worth watching!!

However, \"...Into Darkness\" plays like a bunch of fanboys throwing their fave Trek scenes into a hat, pulling them out randomly, pasting them together and calling it a script.We have 'Khan', the greatest Trek villain of them all...and, one of the greatest in SciFi history...or, do we? The role is miscast with the extraordinary actor Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's 'Sherlock'). Do I believe that he is brilliant...ruthless...superior? Absolutely. Do I believe him to be Khan Noonian Singh? Not for a moment...he is too elegant to be believed as the ultimate, genetically engineered warlord. What's worse, Khan's marvelous backstory is hardly mentioned...and, is only used as a plot device to give Leonard Nimoy an absolutely unnecessary cameo.The laziness/sloppiness of the 'screenwriting'reaches its nadir, when the \"...enter the radiation-filled chamber/save the ship/die a hero's death/miraculously come back from the dead...\" routine from 'Wrath of Khan' is replayed...but, with Kirk and Spock switching roles. The shark has been well and truly jumped.Finally, we have a lazily contrived series of events, starting with an Away Team adventure that seems more Bowery Boys, than Star Trek. These implausible blunders are supposed to make the audience believe that Kirk is a moronic, purile egotist...demanding to go on a black ops mission in order to avenge a death...AND, that the Admiral in charge of Star Fleet (a mis-used Peter Weller)would sanction it without a 2nd thought. Its hard enough to believe that Kirk would (even out of a need for revenge) risk his ship and crew this way. That the crew would blindly follow him on such an insane (asinine) mission is pure tripe. The movie reaches Ludicrous Speed, when we are asked to believe that a massive ship (and spacedock) could be constructed by this Admiral, without anyone at Star Fleet being the wiser. The theme of building tensions and political backroom skullduggery between the Klingons and Star Fleet, drove many excellent episodes of the Trek canon...and, would have made an interesting movie. So, also, would have a new approach to the Khan/Kirk dynamic.Instead, the mashing of the two creates dual, under-developed plot lines that never mesh...and, its a pity, because the acting is simply superb.The cast of this latest Star Trek incarnation lays full claim to their iconic roles in \"...Into Darkness\", with the exception the (normally) excellent Simon Pegg as 'Scotty'. His borderline goofiness of the first film has gone over to ham-fisted mugging...for which director Abrams must take a large part of the blame.Zachery Quinto has taken Spock fully into the realm of having/acknowledging emotions. I don't cotton to this version of Mr. Spock...it eliminates the constant struggle with his dual nature; but, Quinto does such a superb job navigating the nuances, that you can't help but like the character. Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is the highlight in this movie. Despite the contrivances that the script forces him into, Pine rises above it, and makes the role of Kirk his own. This IS a Captain that a crew would follow, fearlessly on a 5-year mission into Space. The scenes between Pine and Bruce Greenwood (Pike) are marvelous expressions of mentor/student, father/son dynamics...and, completely organic.I was also very disappointed in Michael Giacchino's score. It is (literally) the same score from the previous Trek film, with the Romulan leitmotifs being recycled for Khan, and the Klingons (sounds like a garage band).Bottom line: there is too much to like in \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" to allow me to dismiss it out-of-hand. The cast is on-board, and ready for action...however, the director, screenwriters and composer are all on cruise control.That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox.", "qas": [{"question": "How strong is the story of TV series 'The Avengers' for youngsters?", "id": "2eaec75984862e4e048d9205615e8f06", "answers": []}, {"question": "How good is the story in this serie?", "id": "2cf43d7200e5a1f5fc38f72cc8bdbac3", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The movie looks amazing, with its sci-fi vistas of strange worlds and futuristic technology. The actors are all good too in their roles, playing a range of emotions and styles from silly comedy to intense action and tragedy. So on its own merits, it's certainly a quality action movie with a few amazing sequences of outer space derring-do.However, what's sorely lacking from this installment is any sense of intelligence or philosophy that always infused the &#34;Star Trek&#34; franchise. Now, personally, I am not a Trekkie, but have seen the shows as a kid and watched most of the films. And &#34;Star Trek&#34; was always partially defined by its loftier ambitions, a sense of adventurous exploration that infused fun action with smart ideas on heady topics.This movie does not have any of that. It simply jumps from one explosion to the next, which are still amazing to gawk at. But the actual plot is quite dumb. It tries to sneakily move from one twist to another, but really cannot exist by its own warped logic. Why the bad guys do what they do, it simply doesn't make sense. So besides its general lack of intellect, the story proper is very weak.At the end of the ride though, the general production, big-budget effects and zippy pace were still good enough for me to enjoy the experience. Also, I can see how old-school fans might be bothered by some of the liberties this film takes in retooling the lore.The new Trek is bigger, louder, cooler and sleeker than ever.

I like this new cast, and the films are undeniably entertaining, even if it isn't exactly the Star Trek I used to know and love. Philosophy, ethical debates and the merits of intelligence have largely gone out the window in favor of slam-bang action and cowboy heroics. Still, the original Star Trek always contained some of the latter, so it isn't as jarring a change as it would be if, say Picard and crew starting indiscriminately kicking @$$ and taking names.Star Trek Into Darkness picks up a year (four years in real time) after the events of the first reboot, in which young Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew managed to save Earth from vengeful renegade Romulans. During that time, James T. Kirk, while undeniably talented in the Captain's chair, has still not fully understood the responsibility that comes with sitting in it. After a mission to save a primitive race ends up with Kirk violating the Prime Directive, he is demoted in rank--thanks to an incident report filed by Spock (Zachary Quinto)--and assigned to serve as first officer to his mentor, Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), who will be resuming command of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, devastating acts of terrorism committed by mysterious former Starfleet operative John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) have rocked their largely peaceful society. During an emergency meeting called to deal with the latest attack, Harrison ambushes Starfleet headquarters and causes the death of much of Starfleet's key personnel, including Admiral Pike. Enraged and seeking vengeance, Kirk corners Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) and volunteers to lead a manhunt for Harrison into the Neutral Zone and beyond, to Qo'noS (Kronos), the homeworld of the mysterious Klingon Empire. But what Kirk doesn't know is that there is more to \"John Harrison\" than meets the eye...Might as well get to it... **MANY SPOILERS AHEAD**So it's not really a spoiler, everyone knows by now that \"John Harrison\" is just a cover identity for none other than one Khan Noonien Singh. If you only know Benedict Cumberbatch from BBC's Sherlock, prepare to be mesmerized as he kicks all manner of ass here playing the Trek universe's preeminent villain. I do think J.J. Abrams and company could have tried a little harder to find someone who is not a pasty Englishman to play Khan, one of the more important characters in Trek lore; Sendhil Ramamurthy (\"Heroes\") comes to mind as a good candidate, an actual Indian. However, at the end of the day the performance is what really matters, and Cumberbatch gives a terrific one. (I mean, he's no Montalban, but then who is?) Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why Khan looks so different, coming from an era before the timeline was altered.Khan's presence here, of course, means plenty of \"homages\" and reworkings of famous scenes from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, including a reversal of Spock's poignant death scene. Here, it's Kirk who selflessly sacrifices himself for the sake of the crew, while his friend Spock looks on helplessly. It's an iffy thing, recreating one of the best-known and most emotional scenes in all of Trek, and they almost pull it off except for two factors, a combination of bad writing and misplaced fan service:The first is some clumsy foreshadowing earlier in the film where McCoy (Karl Urban) is experimenting on a dead Tribble using some of Khan's blood, which now has some incredible healing properties apparently...? Someone asks him what he's doing, and he says, basically, \"Oh, I'm just experimenting with this dead Tribble [for no logical reason] using this blood, it's got the most amazing regenerative properties I've ever seen, blah blah blah\"; it's inserted so awkwardly into the ongoing action that even newbies will think, \"Hmm, gee, I wonder if THAT information is going to be important later?\" Meanwhile, members of the audience who've seen Wrath of Khan already are now ten steps ahead of the film and know exactly where this is going.The second (and the worst moment of the film, for my money) comes after Kirk has succumbed to radiation and Spock, mute with rage, looks at his now-dead friend, then screams \"KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!\" Words can't accurately convey just how convey how goofy this moment is, how much it damages the emotion of that moment. I get why they put it in; it's one of the key things, if not THE key thing, that most people remember from Wrath of Khan, and they were going to shoehorn it in somewhere. And yes, sometimes fan service is cool, IF IT SERVES THE STORY YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL. If it doesn't fit the movie, you've got to let it go. The original worked so well because it was a character moment. It's hammy, campy, over-the-top, and yet it's rooted in genuine rage all at the same time. You need a guy like Shatner, who can be hammy, over-the-top and seem genuine all at the same time, to sell a line like that. Zachary Quinto, for all his particular strengths, is not that guy.So finally, at the end, Spock gets mad and goes after Khan, proceeding to beat him into a pulp. I feel like the filmmakers are creating an unfortunate trend in this new Trek universe where Spock is more or less encouraged to fly off the handle, something that would be considered anathema to the Spock we've come to know and love over 40+ years. At one point, Khan belittles Spock, saying \"you can't even bring yourself to break bones.\" So at the end of the picture, what do we see? Spock breaking Khan's bones during their fight, something that is presented as a triumphant moment. I recognize that this is, strictly speaking, not the same character as before, but I feel it's a detriment to the character that, instead of using his two main traits--intelligence and resolve--to win out, Spock just has to \"hulk out\" a little now and it's enough to save the day.Oh yeah, and the Klingons were completely wasted. They were in and out of the movie in less than five minutes! The filmmakers could have used any other alien race, could have placed Harrison on any number of alien planets beyond the Neutral Zone, and it would not have mattered. It's a real disappointment that the reintroduction of the most important culture in Trek outside of Earth and Vulcan is so casually tossed off. Truly a letdown.**END SPOILERS**Star Trek Into Darkness has many, many flaws, but it's still entertaining as a popcorn adventure with at least some big ideas. It still isn't terribly original yet, but maybe with a second sequel the filmmakers can finally craft some new ideas instead of remixing old ones. If Abrams and Co. do decide to make a third film, hopefully they will finally embrace some of the headier aspects of Trek (though it isn't likely). The performances are good, Cumberbatch's in particular. Watch and enjoy... but don't think too hard about it.Picture and sound quality were great when I saw them in the theater, as expected. The 3D was very well integrated, especially in the opening scenes, even though the film is just as impressive visually in 2D (we saw it twice). I will update this review with Blu Ray specs when it comes out.**********Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Weller, Bruce GreenwoodDirected By: J.J.

The inferences & nods to past TV episodes & the early movies of the 80's are in of themselves so richly rewarding. You will find yourself unable to control your smiling as you discover the creativeness of the writing, as the originality of the story keeps that 'alternate reality' concept going. This film is one of the most enjoyable films to come out in a long, long time. It is thoroughly entertaining. The audience I saw it with stood up and clapped. When was the last time you experienced that in a movie theater? As previously stated 'STID' propels you on a non stop roller coaster ride but also has a great deal of heart as well. The friendship dynamic between Spock & Kirk is further developed in a really great, dramatic way. Some reviewers poo-pooed the character traits of all the beloved crew as being tired & predictable. However, as a Star Trek fan, isn't that what we've come to expect? In fact a true fan would be truly disappointed if Scotty & McCoy did not behave accordingly. A major surprise awaits and is done in such a subtle unexpected manner that you never see it coming. That's all I'll say on that or I'll have to be indited for being a huge spoiler. There are a ton of special F/X but they are done well and are not over bearing, in fact they add & give the movie it's richness. I met Gene Roddenberry when I was in college and was in awe of the man. I know in my heart that he would be very proud of this handling of his brain-child. Kudos to J.J. Abrams, Kurtzman & Orci for the respect and dignity they continue to give this much loved story & the characters who inhabit the world of Star Trek. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto shine. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly one of the best villains to come along in years. His malevolence & charm are a wonder to behold.

Having watched it from start to finish - having sifted through its colorless performances, its grim but determined story exploring the nature of the great American workplace - I'm kinda/sorta stuck on what I could positively say about it, other than to remark that I felt like I needed a long, hot shower afterwards.  Performances are good, mostly, though there are many, many moments that were unconvincing (at least to me); and the script made use of its central conceit - a telephone call from a faceless voice alleging to be a police officer who spends, literally, an entire workday directing people to do things that are clear violations of the law - for far too long for it to be remotely credible.  (Yes, I know it's BASED on a true story.)For example, imagine that you did something stupid.  Embarrassingly stupid.  Violated and demeaned and debased yourself in ways you can't even bring yourself to put in your head as you sit here reading this review.  Imagine that only you and, say, 50 other people have ever been documented in the history of the known universe into doing the same senseless, insane, stupid thing that broke multiple laws, harmed countless people, and exposed everyone to tremendous legal, personal, emotional, and psychological jeorpardy.  And, yes, I mean REALLY stupid.  Capital `S' stupid.  Feloniously stupid.Then, imagine someone made a film about it.See, what happens when you make a small or big budget picture about something so grievously wrong is that you end up glamorizing it by the very nature of finding the story fit for the telling and retelling.  You give it more credence than what it deserves by crafting a narrative, in securing finances, by hiring actors and technicians and an entire crew, and capturing such inane stupidity in bold, imaginative colors.  You bring it to life in a way that transcends the trivial - why, after all, would you WANT to bring this story to life since, statistically, this occurrence establishing itself as a norm is beyond comprehension?Well, the only answer to that I can give is that you want to deliver a message.If the message is benign and not meant to indirectly satirize or even lampoon the folks involved, then I'd imagine that your message is intending to educate others about the perils of this happening to them.  That, in itself, is a good message ... but, if that's the case, why wouldn't you say as much in the narrative?  If the message is, let's say, one of indifference, that you don't have a clear message, and you only wanted to pose the circumstances and then have folks \"discuss it,\" then again it's mostly benign, but what guarantee would you make your investors?  \"Here, I want to make this picture just to get the audience talking because the more they talk the more money you can make back on your investment.\"  That certainly wouldn't inspire me to give money to such a project.  Lastly, if your message is one of indirect harm - one meaning to exploit a tragedy and indirectly denigrate the stunning number of knuckleheads a pathological liar managed to implicate - should you be allowed to make such a picture?  Isn't that `libel,' of a sort?Because so much of COMPLIANCE ends up glorifying the actions of the charlatan who got the ball in this story rolling, then, sadly, I'm only left with the impression that Zobel intended to exploit a tragedy for material gain, meaning \"a hit film.\"I'd encourage you to Google how poorly the film was received at Sundance, how the audience there were treated by Zobel (keep in mind I wasn't there so I'm only communicating second-hand impressions), and then sit back and think about what you just watched.  Think about all of the filmmakers who've engaged audiences for years - decades, in fact - and then think about how Zobel greeted what sounded like an unsupportive audience: \"I don't like to say people are stupid, so the film for me was retroactively saying, 'What part of human nature lets this happen?'\"  When you glorify violence against women - young, old, large, small, and there are plenty of victims in this picture - do you think you should proactively respond by indicting possibly your audience?If you want to know more about COMPLIANCE, then check out the other reviews.  Others will gladly and graciously cover the plot, give kudos to the cast and crew, tell you the highs and lows, etc.  Occasionally, I'd rather know how someone felt about the film, and it didn't make me feel good.  Not about myself but about those who made it.  Call me a prude, if you like.  I've been called worse.COMPLIANCE is produced by Bad Cop Bad Cop Film Productions, Dogfish Pictures, and Muskat Filmed Properties.  DVD distribution is being handled through Magnolia Pictures.  As for the technical aspects, the production looks and sounds solid.  This isn't a bright film (stylistically), and it isn't meant to be.  It's necessary drenched in dark colors.  There's nothing kid-friendly about it, and you probably don't want to watch it as a date movie, that's for sure.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  While I think there's something of value in any motion picture, I'm hard pressed to give COMPLIANCE a full recommendation.  Certainly, human resources and training professionals might find greater value in the film than the lay person (and I say this as someone who has worked in H.R.).  Otherwise, there's so much that happened here that just defies belief.  Yes, I know it was based on a true story, and, yes, the film cites that over seventy similar incidents are on record, but seventy incidents compared to the entire population of the world means the probability of it being a `phenomenon' is ridiculously rare.  Instead, I'd imagine that writer/director Zobel and much of the Hollywood Left delight at glamorizing yet one more time how stupid Americans can be misled to do horrifically stupid things.Oh, yeah ... last I knew, we learned it from the movies, no?", "qas": [{"question": "How is the quality of premise?", "id": "3731b731bc6ba5256539d3445acad5d1", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00A27O5AW", "paragraphs": [{"context": "I am a devoted fan of the Phryne Fisher books , so it was impossible to pass this series up.

It has its good moments and some slow areas. It had way too many attempts at humor that were not humorous.Premise: Pot dealer creates a fake family to help him travel to Mexico and smuggle drugs back to the US. The movie details the antics they encounter.Acting: Top notch by all. Although all the actors do a great job, Will Poulter(Kenny, the \"son\"), is the show stealer. Jason Sudeikis(David, the father) gets most of the good one liners. Jennifer Anniston, Nick Offerman, Kathyrn Hahn and Emma Roberts also do a great job.Writing: This is where the movie sags. With such a great cast, they simply did not have enough material for the entire movie and attempted to use profanity and 'out of place' sexual content to compensate. This unnecessarily limited their audience base. If they had concentrated a bit more on the writing, this could have been an outstanding comedy that was more acceptable for a wider audience.Funniest scenes:[...][...]Special effects: NoneFamily friendly: Movie is about drugs and drug smuggling, graphic sexual discussions are common, profanity is the norm. Lots of \"F\" bombs. Stripping and brief frontal male nudity are also present. This is not a movie I would show with kids, teenagers nor guests but that is just me.

Have you noticed what absolutely jaw-dropping reviewers there are on Amazon?  There really is absolutely no reason or need to read the 462nd review in order to determine if this program will appeal to you.  Again, especially when the best of the best have already outlined everything you need to know. The only person who will ever read this review is my husband when Amazon emails the confirmation that it has gone live!  :-)  Still, I will add my stars to the tab this remarkable series is racking up.  I can't sleep and need something to do.From the opening of the first episode I was taken in the grip of this drama.  It had me by the throat and punched me in the gut.  I literally couldn't breathe in some parts.  Be warned, it is most of the time so painful to watch.  I cried.  I couldn't help it.  I got caught up in it.  As a parent, I had no problem whatsoever relating to the nightmare unfolding in the lives of the family of the murdered boy. Talk about intense! I started watching as soon as the first episode became available and therefore had to wait until each subsequent episode was released.  I actually didn't watch each episode as soon as it was downloaded because I didn't know if I could take any more!  But I did continue to watch.  I had to...a saga about each individual in the show was being revealed.  It became more than the effect this death had on the victim's family.  It expanded to every single person in the small community of Broadchurch.Don't expect any relief or distraction from the horror of the murder of a young boy.  It was sad without any let up.  The music was beautiful and haunting.  There was no waking up from the nightmare and the sun coming up in the morning.  Which is exactly what I imagine it would be like to live through such a traumatic event. There is no happy ending.  The final episode, 8, is a devastating reveal of the murderer and the added trauma it causes. Someone murdered this child in a small close-knit community.  It must have been a stranger that did this evil thing, right?  Could finding out that the murderer is someone known to this traumatized family make it even more painful? Perhaps. Still, Broadchurch is a beach front \"tourist\" town so it is probably a stranger.  When suspicion begins to be cast about...upon locals...what is the resulting response of everyone!  Good questions. These questions are faced in this series.I liked the writing.  I liked the way the story was told.  I got right away that this was more than a whodunit. I liked that I wasn't \"let in\" on who the killer was or even what motivated the murder.  (I give no clues whatsoever on who the murderer ends up to be.  Who knows, my husband may want to watch this and I want him to see for himself. The writer was making a point.  I got the impression that a philosophy was being put forth.  For me, the \"lesson\" was one of not jumping to conclusions, that appearances can definitely be deceiving; things aren't usually as straight forward as they first appear.  Peoples' actions and behavior always has a why behind them.  (Someone says something and I always wonder to myself, \"Why\" did they say that?  And a lot of the time the dialogue in both film and books, for me, is hugely disconnected between what is said and why a person would possibly say it.  Would they really say that?)  You know, the character being put forth says and does something that should be totally out of character.  Maybe that's just my thing.  In regards to the lessons I thought being put forth, they are pretty much universally known but not regularly represented in television viewing today.  At least IMO not in the genre that I enjoy.  People seem more commonly represented as rather shallow.  Which doesn't represent at all what I imagine folks in the portrayed roles would be like to do the jobs they do.  I think it is nice to have to unravel the layers of folks, myself, rather than have it done for me.  I enjoyed how \"the why\" which motivated and shaped each person's behavior was revealed.  How and why did they get where they were in their lives?  Some sins do indeed have long shadows and they don't necessarily have to be your own.  So, how do people live through, get beyond, and even overcome events in their lives.  There are a lot of walking wounded.  And they abound in this program. Some programs are pure escapism, not this one. It's a drama, a tragedy. It is not a typical crime procedural (I believe that is the term.) I didn't think that this show was mainly about solving the murder.  It was mainly about how the murder effected the family and then in a ripple effect every other person in the community and further.I was transported from my sofa into the community of Broadchurch.  I became a neighbor and emotionally connected.  By developing the characters over several episodes there was a greater depth to everyone.I can't find fault with any of the acting. It was completely top-notch.  I am a huge fan of British programming and I am constantly awed by the degree of greatness in the acting!  These folks are good.  They don't get their roles because they look good on camera and in jeans without a T-shirt!  I've never followed the Dr. Who series so am not familiar with Tenant in that role.  I thought he was masterful.  He played a mournful and deeply scarred person to perfection.  He was driven in his pursuit of the truth.  I wanted to know what had happened to him that had shaped him. He was an outsider in Broadchurch. He was sent there to solve this murder. His connection was personal, that was made plain, but it wasn't a connection to the victim or anyone involved.  Now, on the other hand, Detective Ellie was a local.  Her son was a close friend of the murdered boy.  Her family was closely connected to and lived just a few doors down from the victim.  Like everyone else in Broadchurch this was up-close-and-personal. She should have been in charge of the case but arriving to the office was blindsided by having Tenant assigned instead.  To add insult to injury she was forced to endure his rough and insensitive manner. The suspects were her friends and she began the investigation pretty much unable to even consider that someone she knows could have committed such an atrocity to one of their own. As the story unfolds she begins to see people once so familiar to her in different ways.  The actress who played her was brilliant.  I've seen her around in other programs but never would have expected such a riveting and realistic portrayal.  The emotion she brought to the role was astounding.  She was completely believable and real to me.  I definitely have respect for her ability as an actress now!  I can only imagine what a role like this would mean to an actress who previously in her career was relegated to small ho-hum parts. (At least those I saw.) I will definitely be learning her name and looking for her in further roles. (I'm writing this in the middle of the night, from my email page, you know how Amazon prompts you to review something you've purchased, so don't have this info in front of me BUT I will be looking it up in the AM!) It would be a glaring omission not to mention how well all the other roles were acted.  The young murdered boy was painfully beautiful.  His parents portrayed the crippling and devastating blow of losing their son absolutely superbly. You'll see the supporting characters perform their parts perfectly.  I didn't find fault with any and appreciated the casting.At the conclusion we are notified that \"Broadchurch will return.\"  For me, I will watch to see what the writer(s) will bring to the screen next.  I would like to see what happens to these folks.  Could I stand to see another 8 episodes of such heart wrenching melancholy? I'm really not sure.  This offering was painful for me.  It was so real. So, in follow-up programming I would like to see something with the intense acting, superb writing but perhaps a little relief from the drama.  I don't need comedy.  I'm talking some breathing room.  A person needs to be able to breathe when a program is nearly 8 hours long.  Anyway, I'll be taking a peek at what might be happening next in Broadchurch.The rating is appropriate for the content of the subject matter.  There were no scenes of graphic sex or gory violence a change of what one normally sees these days in any kind of drama involving murder.  No autopsies or mutilated corpse was depicted.  (The subject matter was horrific enough without adding any of that!) The only sex scene was of the couple after the act and both were either clothed or completely covered. All of these things are something I greatly appreciate because I don't want to see it.  There is mild swearing that I've come to expect in a program of this rating and I think only one use of the \"F\" word at the end.", "qas": [{"question": "What is the most popular series?", "id": "df4cafbdef5939a1a9023edd1755c3c5", "answers": []}]}]}, {"title": "B00BEIYN9Q", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Theatrical review.  May contain spoilers.It could be just my imagination but it seems that about this time every year Denzel Washington stars in an action based film with just enough comedy in the mix to warm up to audiences.  This year is no exception.  He teams up with Mark Wahlberg who is no stranger to the genre either.Bobby (Washington) and Stig (Wahlberg) are seemingly a pair of bank robbing, drug runners doing business in Mexico with one of the feared cartels headed by Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos).  The pair, knowing where $3 million of drug money is held, decide to rob the small bank and clean out the safety deposit box.  Little did they expect that every deposit box had cash in it, totally $43 million.It is no surprise thanks to the trailers that all is not what it seems.  Bobby is actually an undercover DEA agent and Stig is a Navy specialist also working under cover.  Neither were aware of the other's involvement.  It turns out that their bosses were both in on a complicated subterfuge and neither operative was aware.  To make things even dicier, the money actually belongs to the CIA's dirty man-in-charge (a convincingly despicable Bill Paxton).  If you're not confused enough, Bobby's sometime girlfriend Deb (drop dead gorgeous Paula Patton) is a co-worker who may or may not be involved somehow.There is one thing for sure.  There is a lot of gun play and plenty of explicit violence, but what makes it all work is the give and take between Stig and Bobby.  It is damn funny stuff.  Washington and Wahlberg have great chemistry and perfect timing.  The film is directed by Iceland's Baltasar Kormakur Samper who is also responsible for \"Contraband\" also starring Wahlberg.  I give bonus points for a pair of surprises from Ms. Patton.

With that said if you are looking for a movie like Money Ball this is not the movie for you.  This is more of a Kevin Smith film in that it is not all physical comedy but a comedy controlled by the free flowing of the script and the banter between the actors.  Yes there was lots of physical humor as well but that was not the point.  The point was to get us to listen to the jokes that they were laying on each other.

at the Oz franchise and once again comes up short.It has a weak and meandering plot and an even weaker leading man.The story finds our wizard as a side show entertainer in a circus,who longs to be more than he is.He is a magician whose bag of tricks are getting very old,very fast.He is good with the ladies but does not want to be pinned down by any one in particular,even one who would like to marry him.One day the circus strongman comes after him and he hops aboard the circus balloon to save himself.However this results in his balloon getting sucked into a passing tornado.When he lands on the other side he is in the land of Oz.The first person he is greeted by is a good witch named Theadora.The two hit it off,as the wizard turns on the charm,and the two end up practically engaged;at least in Theadora's mind.When they reach the Emerald City,Theodora's sister Evanora is there waiting their arrival.His presence has alerted the entire kingdom and the prophecy of the returning wizard,they think,is apparently being fulfilled.Evanora tells him the kingdom is his to rule when he destroys the wicked witch who resides in the dark forest.The wizard leaves for the dark forest with a flying monkey called Finlay he met on the way to Oz,and along the way he picks up another traveling companion,a cute little china doll.When they reach their destination they find their quarry and plan to just steal her wand and break it.Their plans go awry and they come face to face with her.As it turns out it is Glinda,the good witch of the south.Evanora has tricked both the wizard and her own sister Theodora.Evannora,to retain an ally,shows her sister the goings on with Glinda through her crystal ball.It makes Theodora enraged.She gets so mad she takes a bite of an apple Evanora gives her,which turns her into a hideous green skinned evil witch.The wizard meanwhile has been introduced to a  variety of Oz inhabitants by Glinda,including Quadlings,Tinkerers and Munchkins.The wizard and Glinda concoct a plan to attack the Emerald City.The first attack is by robotic scarecrows through the poppy field.Glinda lays a low\"fog\"over the poppies to hide them and as the flying monkeys descend down to field level,they almost all fall asleep.However two grab and whisk away Glinda.The wizard now has to hatche a further plan to get Glinda back.He has a balloon float seemingly away from the city with the him aboard.The balloon is destroyed by Theodora,and the bait is taken.The wizard reappears courtesy of a holographic like projector with smoke,which he uses to intimidate the two witches.Theordora flies off on her broom,while Evanora flees into her castle.There she and Glinda have it out and Glinda defeats her,but Evanora is taken away by two flying monkeys.The film comes to its conclusion as the wizard presents his friends with gifts for their support and he takes Glinda behind his curtain for a romantic kiss.The leading character in a film like this, would have to have been played by someone with good acting skills,and with charisma and panache,as that is who this movie revolves around when all is said and done.Franco was terribly miscast.His acting is weak and he looks terribly uncomfortable in his role.This undermined,for me,the entire movie,despite all the good special effects this movie spewed forth.Any moment of pathos,drama or comedy were severally weakened by his inability to \"bring it\".He couldn't even come up to the level of his fellow players,and as a result dragged many of them down with him.As with many a Sam\"Evil Dead\"Raimi film,the director once again cast his old friend Bruce Campbell in a small supporting role.He is the guard at the gates of the Emerald City who gets hit on the head by Finlay(Mr.Campbell I'm sure could make much out of that!).I bring Bruce's appearance up for one reason:THAT is who should have been cast in the lead role.Bruce Campbell could have given that character exactly what the role called for;a depth and humour Franco couldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.This film is kind of a prequel to the Oz books themselves,but it does mention characters like Quadlings,Winkies,and others that appear in the original books but have never been mentioned on film before.The film also has the odd salute to the /39 film.Watch as the wizard leaves the Emerald City.In the background in a field,is the\"horse of a different colour\".The best part of the film,I found,was the china doll character;CGI created at that.Technically speaking the film starts out in black and white,in a square box,center screen.Then when the wizard reaches Oz,the screen expands to a 2:40:1 a/r and colour.The picture was clear and crisp.As with many Disney one disc DVDs,there are no extras.All in all with a weak plot and an even weaker leading man,this film was doomed to fail.I couldn't get behind or believe Franco's role for one second.The special effects are good but it is not enough to make up for its other

Critics and fans on the movie sites I go to have been raving about this film, so I had to check it out and chime in. I agree with those who say that newcomer, Tye Sheridan, gives an amazing performance, but as for the rest of the film, I think it leaves something to be desired. While out exploring, two boys meet a strange man named Mud, stranded on an island. This man is full of stories and needs the boys help to reconnect with his girlfriend and leave the island. For starters, the film is full of inconsistencies. Mud is starving and needs these boys to bring him food, but somehow, he always has a cigarette in his mouth. One or two things could be overlooked, but the inconsistencies fill up this film. While it's a good story, there isn't a lot of substance to it and the film moves at a snails pace, another thing that tends to turn viewers away. The best thing to do would have been to use flashbacks in Mud's stories to fill the time, instead there are a lot of symbolic scenes of people lost in thought, the business of the town, the kids hanging out, it was very methodical, but also very dull. Matthew McConaughey plays Mud and does a decent job, the problem doesn't lie with him. The film is based on this guy, and for a character with such an interesting past, he really is a sad, dull guy. The only real positive I took away from this film was Tye Sheridan, who plays one of the boys. He does a tremendous job as he starts to realize that love isn't everlasting. To see how this character matures from the beginning of the film to the end, is really remarkable, but it's not unique. Off the top of my head, I can think of a dozen similar stories, where the film is much more interesting and the same thing ends up happening. Mud is ambitious and may be the start of a long career for two young actors, but ultimately it's long, slow, and forgettable.", "qas": [{"question": "How is the quality of the film?", "id": "906d58101a444cc49c20814985fa31d3", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "McConaughey has another solid performance.

Having been too young to watch and listen to the original lone ranger series when it originally was aired, I did as a kid see them as reruns, I can see where the criticisms come from when comparing the two as this is not what I would consider the Lone Ranger as it was originally intended. With that being said, if you strictly compare the two, then yes this version will fail to live up to your expectations, especially if you grew up on the original. But if view this as something different, then this movie although not a classic, is fun and entertaining. Yes the character interaction and lines are a bit campy, the action over the top, and the movie a bit too long at times but it did keep me entertained. I did think the flashbacks (or flash forwards as they were) with the little boy at the carnival were a bit distracting from the movie and really felt out of place and kind of ruin the pacing of the film. I would almost compare this movie as a mix of Wild Wild West (which this movie is better) and Pirates of the Carribean (which this movie is not as good as). This movie has a mix of light-hearted humor, sarcasm, and some violence and tries to entertain all ages, which actually I think it is its biggest problem.

Since buying Pixar, Disney is kind of getting the idea again that if they make good movies, they will make more money.  Good for them.  In particular, Tangled is one of Disney's best movies in almost every respect.  Wonderful dialog, music, etc.  I was hoping (and people led me to believe) that this would follow in the same tradition.Unfortunately Frozen is dominated in every respect by Tangled.  But it's still an ok movie.  Instead of being a musical movie (plot that makes sense and several very memorable songs) it's much more like a broadway musical (plot that is garbage and lots of music woven in, none of which is really all that catchy).  The plot in this one is pretty thin and it would be easy to poke holes in it.  That's not the worst flaw in the world since it's pretty common in movies, especially those that intend to have children as a major part of the audience.My biggest beef with this movie is the characterization.  There isn't much.  You don't really empathize much with any of the characters and there isn't a ton of growth and development.  There's the handsome guy that turns out to be a bad guy, but he really isn't much of an antagonist and is only present in a few scenes.  Also he had no reason to be as bad as he was.  Really the only reason for his character to exist is that they needed some conflict so the one girl can show an unselfish loving act.  But there were other characters and situations that could have filled that role.  Instead I think Disney was just trying to teach the message that you shouldn't get married on a whim.  I guess it's not the worst message.  The &#34;main&#34; character who has the ice powers isn't that great a character.  She doesn't have that many redeeming qualities and besides learning to control her power she doesn't  grow much in the film.  The sled guy, this reindeer, and the snowman are all ok for comic relief, but they weren't developed very well either, I thought.  Pretty flat.People have made a big deal about the pro-homosexual undercurrent of the movie.  I think that mainly has to do with our political environment today, not the movie.  It's really subtle.  Mostly there's a strong sense in the movie that going off and doing your own thing regardless of whether it makes other people happy is the way to personal progress.  Not the best moral in the world, but it's passable (better than, say, Pocahontas, where the moral is that white men are evil but if they could just learn to be indians we would all be better off).  People have talked about this being a good sisterly love movie but it's actually pretty weak that way.  The sisters hardly know each other.  The one sister is always trying to be loyal but the ice sister is pretty much a jerk or a drama queen all the way through and never changes.  I wouldn't recommend it on those grounds.The music in this movie is what I would call passable.  If you liked the music in wicked, you will like this.  What you get is a few moments within songs that are great, but not whole songs that you will remember or find yourself singing later.  That was a big disappointment.  Simply put, the Andersen-Lopez team is no Alan Menken.  Not by a very long shot.  Nevertheless if you don't try and compare the music to the greater Disney works of the past, you will find that it is painless and even enjoyable.One major bone for me: the voice acting and singing of the ice princess.  Idina Menzel is famous for her role in Wicked and other things and the movie really wanted to capitalize on that, but her voice is clearly too old for the character she plays.  I find it difficult to watch movies where the character's voice clearly doesn't match her look and age.  I'm not the biggest Idina Menzel fan anyway, but if she had played a character that was 20 years older and more mature I wouldn't have had an issue with it.  On the other hand, Kristen Bell, who played the other sister, was brilliant at acting and singing.Overall I felt like the movie meandered.  It kind of seemed like it was heading to a coherent plot but then the big climax, which was a disappointing but also expected deux ex machina, comes and I sort of walked away feeling like it was an ok ride.I don't regret owning this.  If you haven't seen it already, go in with low expectations and you will end up happy.", "qas": [{"question": "How was the story?", "id": "69ac131b51d6eccee5cbc2e07b878978", "answers": [{"text": "Since buying Pixar", "answer_start": 76}]}]}, {"context": "Frozen[Theatrical Review]As animated features go, Disney is tops.  Unlike the morality tales of Pixar films (which I do love, that&#8217;s no insult on them!), Frozen goes a step back to a more traditional method of storytelling.  Like Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, Frozen takes us through a story of love, of betrayal, and of family.I&#8217;m sure sisters have felt shut out by their fellow siblings.  This film does reflect that.  It also tells us not to rush into anything, like marriage, as that person could really be a wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing.The characters are developed well in this story of two sisters, Elsa (the young and feisty one) and Anna (the magic one, whose powers of ice and snow make her consider herself a freak with a curse).  Their ups & downs in relationships between each other, and the love they have for each other is quite a change from the usual boy-meets-girl-Prince Charming style of Disney films.The music is fresh and original.  The film plays like a musical and most of the themes deal with tackling life head-on and not be dissuaded from your goals and purposes.The story is inspired from Hans Christian Anderson&#8217;s tale of The Snow Queen.The theater version starts with a short, that plays like an old Walt Disney 1940s&#8217; style black & white cartoon, but then morphs into a modern story with plenty of slapstick.  Great start!I really liked the Snow Queen, who hurt her sister and did not want a repeat of that.  But thought protecting her by not revealing herself, she actually hurt her sister emotionally and the younger one was shut out.  I&#8217;m sure kids will relate to this.Bottom Line:  If you love castles, dancing, some comedy relief and some traditional Disney style, look no further than Frozen.  Even Olaf the Snowman was a trip.  The special effects were excellent; the detail down to the fibers of cloth and the features of stone and design were amazing.Highly recommended.Cast:Kristen Bell l  ...

The Lion King was the peak of Disney animation.  After that Disney animated films were on the decline and Pixar took over for a while.  However, that could be about to change.  If Disney continues to put out movies as good as or better than Frozen then we may have another Disney golden age.Frozen is the story of two sisters Anna and Elsa.  Elsa has the ability to create ice and snow, but she cannot control it.  Her parents end up locking her away from all human contact until she can control it.  She eventually becomes queen and finally opens the gates to the public again.  She freaks out at the party and accidently uses her ability which terrifies the crowd.  She runs away and decides to live in isolation in the icy mountains.  It is then up to her sister Anna to bring her back.Frozen is the story of the Ice Queen but told from a different angle.  When you think of the ice queen you think that she is the villain.  However, in Frozen she is not evil but more misunderstood, which I did not expect.  This story could be really fun or feel really forced.  Fortunately this movie was extremely fun, well-paced, well-acted, and well animated.  The characters are really fun and relatable.Most of the songs were also good.  One of the things I love about this film is that it is a Disney animated film not a Pixar film.  Frozen is a Disney 2D animated film in 3D animation.  While in 3D animation this film is not a comedy like most of them are.  It has much humor in it, but it places focus on the story and the dramatic moments more than humor.  Plus it is a musical like the old Disney films, which is a welcome change.  I also like how they make fun of past Disney tropes like a prince and princess falling in love instantly without getting to know one another.There are some issues I have with the film, though most are minor.  Firstly, I kind of wish this was done in 2D animation.  I do not dislike 3D animation, but I do like the 2D style of animation more.  Plus, I am so used to pure Disney animated movies like this in 2D that seeing one in 3D did not entirely click with me.  Another is the songs.  The songs are good (like I said earlier) but I do not find them really memorable.  Many of the big 2D Disney films had at least one memorable song that stuck with you forever.  Lion King and Beauty and the Beast had a ton like Be Our Guest, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, etc.  Little Mermaid had songs like Under The Sea, Pocahontas has Colors of The Wind, Oliver and Company had Why Should I Worry?, etc.  I do not find the songs in Frozen as memorable those.  I actually think the story could have worked just as well without songs.Another problem I have is with the villain.  The problem is that they reveal who the main villain is in the third act.  To be honest it really comes out of nowhere.  Not to mention the villain is very bland.  I have seen this villain in many Disney films and even films in general.  I get what they were going for with the reveal but I still did not really care for it and thought it was too out of left field.Overall, Frozen is Disney&#8217;s best films in a while.  It is fun and funny when it wants to be and dark and serious when it needs to be.  The characters (save one) are all likable and fun to watch.  The effects were amazing and very well done.

Unmistakably good, at that. Whereas the last couple of Pixar movies have descended to fairly typical Disney fare, Frozen rises towards the kind of film we haven't seen from Pixar since Toy Story 3 (a movie that made me cry, and I don't cry at movies very often). It's not as good as TS3, but it's definitely the best Disney Animation movie in a good long while.In an effort to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels. Olaf steals every scene he's in, and my kids loved him. Seriously, my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him, and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his &#34;puddle&#34; song as they can remember. My daughter, who is less interested in movies than the boys, would have turned right around and seen it again.The animation in the movie was, in a word, incredible, especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge. The songs are good (and who knew Kristen Bell could sing? Okay, so, well, maybe lots of people, but I didn't know, so I was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs), and, as I've already implied, the song by Olaf was really catchy.The best parts of the movie, however, can't be talked about without being spoilery: You've been warned.The death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for Disney. I'm not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type, but it's almost always the case. Possibly, for Frozen, it's there to help you feel as if you're in a typical Disney film (I kind of doubt it), but, whatever the reason, you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that they're not coming back. Of course, that's what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie. Elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it.One of the best moments is between Anna and Kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone (Hans) that she had just met that day. It's very amusing, because the immediate True Love thing is so endemic in Disney movies, so it's refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie. In fact, the catalyst of the whole thing is Elsa (now the Queen) refusing to allow the marriage between Anna and Hans because they had only just met.

Let's just say that the movie ended with both Anna and Elsa growing as characters, something that Brave, unfortunately, lacked.At any rate, it's a very enjoyable movie and one that I hope is signaling a new direction for Disney. Disney Princesses are great and all that, but it's good to have some that don't need to get rescued.Also, Alan Tudyk was great. I didn't even realize that was him until I saw his name in the credits.

Starring Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars), Idina Menzel (Wicked, Glee), Jonathan Groff (Glee), and Josh Gad (The Book of Mormon Musical, Ice Age: Continental Drift), Disney's latest is fresh, bold, and unique in ways that should be applauded.Loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, Frozen centers on two princesses, Elsa (Idina Menzel), the soon-to-be Queen, and Anna (Kristen Bell) of the fictional Norwegian kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa has the ability to create snow and ice, but suppressed these powers after a traumatic childhood incident involving Anna. After her cryokinetic powers got out of hand during her official July coronation, she goes into hiding, but her emotions trigger a magical, eternal winter that freezes the entire kingdom. The arrogant Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk) plots to turn everyone against &#34;the monster&#34; Elsa for his own devilish needs.Let's face it: the marketing for this film has been atrocious.  It has been cryptic to the point of turning folks off of the film.  The synopsis that I just provided above tells you much more than any trailer they've released.  This is too bad, because the film is delightful.Audiences are going to want to compare this to Tangled, which I think is fair, it being the last Disney musical in recent memory.  Tangled is a masterpiece that is a high bar to be up against, but I think Frozen is up to the task.  Therefore, the basis of this review will such a comparison.First off, the music in this true musical (there are 9 musical numbers compared to the 4 in Tangled) is fabulous!  They employed husband-and-wife songwriting team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez to write the songs, and they are fantastic.  I'm listening to the soundtrack as I write this, and it knocks the socks off of Tangled, in my opinion.The vocals are better than Tangled as well, with both Bell and Menzel being better singers than Mandy Moore.  And the amazing voice acting/singing doesn't stop at the leads: Groff and Gad are just as marvelous in their roles.This has been called a feminist film, which I think is true and not in a bad way.  It passes the arbitrary Bechdel test with flying colors, but doesn't try to punch you in the face with any overt feminist messages.  It's just a great movie about two sisters who are trying to navigate their way through the difficult circumstances that they were born to.Visually, the only thing better this year is Gravity.  The 3D is spectacular, although not essential.  The animation is flawless and stunning.Where Frozen falls short of Tangled is in its script.  The script just isn't as tight and the payoff and climax are not nearly as good.  Tangled's ending was so touching and caused me to tear up a bit, where this ending was just plain good and nothing more.  Although, the humor is probably a bit better in Frozen, if only by a hair.Besides a few script issues Frozen will be an instant classic, with its music and voices more than making up for its shortcomings.  I give it a 4.5/5 stars.

First off, I'm a huge fan of animation especially once made by Disney I really enjoyed Tangled and Brave so much to the point where I was expecting Frozen to be made of the same enjoyment but alas the story was muffled, bizarre and completely uncoordinated it felt like a mash up of multiple story lines into one.So, first off The story is supposed to represent *friendship* between two sisters, one has magical powers Elsa who's an albino and the other one is Ana who's very normal and is the sweeter, younger one. While they were playing as kids making magic with Elisa's powers Ana happened to suffer a blow that might've caused her death but thankfully she was saved by some wise trolls who erased her memory of Elsa ever having magical snow powers and warned her family that Elsa's powers will grow by time to be great as well as dangerous if and unless she can control them. So the parents go back to their castle and trap their gifted daughter into a room secluded from people, they suppress her magical powers by making her wear a glove and that continues for years till they go to sea and all of a sudden die. Only during conurbation day does Elsa get to see people including her sister Ana who meets a prince then decided to marry and then Elsa got angry and her magical powers went out of hand then the whole kingdom was put through the so called eternal winter and Elsa ran off, her sister came after her to try and stop her....Everything this movie was throwing at me was predictable. The ending was abrupt and disappointing it made me want more. Maybe I was expecting more? The characters were shallow and one dimensional very naive and stupid? I didn't understand the moral of this story. As an adult I was confused and I am a kid at heart.Skip this movie...", "qas": [{"question": "How is the story?", "id": "db0e963c7beefdc8d9d387a052b0b48f", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "i loved it, i love cartoons, because when i watch them, it brings back the magic of childhood. and you know disney,so what if the original story didn't have such a happy ending, this one does!", "qas": [{"question": "Do you count me a story of music superb?", "id": "405fb92bb8fd30b02b44eec24e92491c", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "The songs are good the storyline lacked something....

Elsa completely pulls away, locking herself away from the world and working to control her powers by suppressing her emotions. Their parents downsize the staff and close the gates to Arendelle to reduce the danger Elsa poses to others. Anna feels abandoned and both girls feel utterly alone. Years later, their parents die in a boating accident, making Elsa the queen of Arendelle. She is forced to open the gates and hold a coronation celebration. The coronation goes well, but her powers are revealed after a heated argument with Anna. She runs away, leaving a wake of ice and snow, making the much needed summer into winter in Arendelle. Anna feels it's her responsibility to make amends with Elsa and convince her to life the supernatural winter.Frozen is a fun film with charming characters and an unexpected ending. Anna and Elsa are both sympathetic characters who feel alienated and alone. I just want to give Elsa a great big hug. She tries her best to contain her powers and her feelings, sacrificing her close relationship with her sister in order to shield her from harm. She is forced to hide a fundamental part of herself in order to appear normal and utterly fails, causing harm to her entire community. I&#34;m glad she wasn't a real villain as in the original story (which is very weird and religious), but a person trying her best and making mistakes. Anna is funny, quirky, and definitely not the poised and graceful Disney princess one might expect. She's very clumsy and embarrassingly blurts out her feelings to random people. She just wants a real relationship with her sister, to be able to make friends, and to have people around instead of cutting themselves off. My favorite character is Olaf, the living snowman who loves warm hugs. He provides perfect comic relief and he's just adorable.Disney films are rather guilty of having two people fall in love rather quickly based on next to nothing and then living happily ever after. It seems as if this film goes in that direction when Anna falls for Prince Hans of the Southern Isles and accepts a proposal within an evening of meeting. When Anna is once again injured by Elsa's magic, her condition is said to be cured by an act of true love, suggesting Hans should save the day. The ending switches things around and Anna is cured because she threw herself in front of Elsa as Hans tried to kill her. The true love in this instance wasn't romantic love, but sisterly love. I really enjoyed this subverting of typical Disney tropes and the story is the best Disney has produced in a while.The music of the film is delightful and another reason for the film's success. The filmmakers opted to hire Broadway composers to create these fun songs of varied styles. Do You Want to Build a Snowman is a cute, but sad song that encompasses Anna and Elsa's relationship after the accident and each of their loneliness and frustration. For the First Time in Forever is a cute song that shows Anna silly and quirky nature and her excitement for human contact and a dash of Elsa's mantra to control her powers. Love is an Open Door is an adorable instalove song between Anna and Hans with more of a rock feel and fun harmonies. In Summer is Olaf's hilarious song about his obsession with summer, but he has no idea what snow does in heat. The song has a nice old Hollywood musical flair and some unexpected lyrics. The best song of the film is Let It Go, Elsa's song of empowerment where she accepts herself despite what others think of her. Idina Menzel belts out the song and gives it the power it needs. The visuals are also amazing as Elsa effortlessly builds an ice castle around herself.The only part of the film I didn't really like was the trolls. They were cute and provided some comedy, but didn't really add much to the story. They could have easily been cut out without anything essential being removed. Other than that, Frozen has my vote for best animated film of 2013.", "qas": [{"question": "How good was the music?", "id": "8bf68b50a46682848142ee5a674f7c07", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "This movie has a great storyline and exceptional music, as well as one of the funniest Disney characters in the last 20 years (Olaf).

Just like with Wolf of Wall Street, I was quite disappointed by it. The story itself seemed to just jump around all over the place, flashing from scene to scene before the first one was finished. The characters as well seemed very uneven as well, making emotional leaps and nosedives all over the place without any real clear reason why.You have our two &#34;leads&#34;, Christina Bale (who I can't take seriously anymore after Batman) and Amy Adams, that are very close one second, then hate each other the next, then are back in close again without any real explanations as to why. They are supposed to be very smart con artists, and yet they don't utilize any of their skills to get out of the jam, or even try to, until the absolute last five minutes of the movie. Not to mention their &#34;chemistry&#34; seemed more like distilled water as opposed to any kind of fiery heat. I honestly couldn't care less if they ended up with each other or not by the end of the movie. And as far as the &#34;friendship&#34; between Bale's character and Renner's character, I only have Bale's voice over to tell me about this, because other than when Renner's character discovers what Bale's really been doing do we see any real emotion regarding the relationship between these two. Oh yes, and we have the film opening things with a shot of Amy Adams' character being a stripper, something that is never even mentioned again. So my question is, why even bother telling the audience about it? It brought absolutely no weight to the movie and quite honestly I forgot about that tidbit about the character five minutes later. The same could be said about Bale's character. The movie opens with him talking about how he shattered windows so his father would get business for his glass company so he wouldn't get &#34;taken&#34; anymore. Exactly how was his father taken? It's never even explained. Was it done legally or illegally? And, of course, there's his dry cleaning business, which is essentially pointless to this movie other than being a set piece in the beginning for Amy Adams to have a fashion show. Even Bale's art scam was pointless, as it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Hell, the scam he and Adams come up with made absolutely no sense. It was never really explained. What exactly were their marks giving them $5,000 for to begin with. Was it an investment, was it supposed to be money laundering? We're never told.You have the FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who is so obsessed with going higher and higher up the criminal food chain that the entire character becomes a cartoon. When he beats the living hell out of his boss because he wouldn't give him an incredibly expensive hotel room for a sting operation, and is then given accolades by his boss's boss instead of being thrown out of the Bureau and charged with battery, at that point the whole movie had jumped the shark. And that's not even talking about his inexplicable use of cocaine in one scene that is never even hinted at again, regardless of his manic behavior throughout the movie.Jeremy Renner did do a fine job in the role he was cast. The character seemed rather sincere and wasn't a typical dirty politician, which was just fine for this movie. I can't say I have any complaints about the character other than it and the actor were wasted on this film.Jennifer Lawrence was fine, I suppose, though instead of being conniving and sneaky in her own loud way, she seemed like she was either a sociopath or someone with bi-polar disorder. Seriously, I doubt you'd have much trouble convincing a judge, even one from the late 70's, that she was in no condition to take full-time custody of her child.Then there were the accents. I was actually ok with Adams' British accent. It wasn't great but it wasn't too terrible either. The problem I had is she was supposed to be from New Mexico and yet she would inexplicably shift into a New Jersey or New York accent when not using her British one. This is after, in the opening scenes, we hear her normal accent which sounds Midwestern. It just makes no sense. That and Alessandro Nivola, Bradley Cooper's boss's boss sounded like he was trying to do a Christopher Walken impression the entire movie.About the only thing this movie had going for it was wardrobe, and by that I mean having the two leading ladies (more Adams than Lawrence) wear outfits that showed off their curves to the utter maximum without being vulgar for the entire movie.Overall, I just found the movie to be pretty bad and find it very disheartening that this and Wolf of Wall Street are what is considered wonderful, powerful movies these days. It seems that the people in Hollywood really know their audiences now and know they can cram any kind of garbage down our throats, as long as their PR people tell us it's the finest cut of filet.

Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us?American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at AH you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film and the use of narration replacing Gangsters and Mobsters with con artists but O'Russell takes the style and makes it his own. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pull you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the reasons the movie succeeds. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style. Terrific direction,O'Russell.The score Danny Elfman isn't always used but good when it's heard.

It is worth seeing in theaters (especially IMAX 3D, as I did) and I feel that when it's on Blu-Ray I'll be analyzing its themes, and visuals for years to come.  Most importantly: I felt genuinely moved by this motion picture.  The scares, the tension, and the emotionally charged climax- it all just rang true for me as a viewer.  Gravity will likely go down as one of 2013's best and is a must-see.", "qas": [{"question": "How many movies should we watch?", "id": "212846ba95fff9c8f8b43b712bf599c5", "answers": []}]}, {"context": "Good acting and the filming of these outer space scenes is incredible.
