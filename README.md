# NLP with Transformers - Follow Along
Implementing the code presented in [*Natural Language Processign with Transformers*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/natural-language-processing/9781098103231/) as a way to consolidate learnings.
Refactored

## Motivation
* Consolidate learnings from the book. 
* Apply some of the refactoring techniques and design principles learned from [#ArjanCodes](https://www.arjancodes.com/)

## Method and Results
Approach:
* read a chapter
* reproduce the experiment
* refactor some of the code (mostly by breaking large code snippets into smaller functions, bringing some OOP to encapsulate more complex workflows)

## How to Install
For each chapter, you can setup a dedicated environment by executing the `setup.sh` script.
